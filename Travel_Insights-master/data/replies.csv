eh8mv27, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-25 12:08:19, 2019, 2,25, I went to maui in 2005 and the north shore drive was beautiful but scary.. i remember dropoffs with no shoulder or guard rail. The road on the south side after Hana looked like the perfect rolling blacktop out of a movie. ,Rexan02\lneh8kua4, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-25 11:17:20, 2019, 2,25, yes! the drive was very enjoyable without crowds of people, and of course Julia’s was amazing ,thankssoymatcha\lneh8v2z0, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-25 14:33:53, 2019, 2,25, I took that southern part of the road to Hana in a Mustang with my 7 month pregnant wife. 

Big mistake.  ,Chopperguy\lneh8uuyj, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-25 14:30:38, 2019, 2,25, I remember doing it but got nervous and turned around as it got very narrow. If another car came I would’ve been terrified backing up. I made it pretty far in though and glad I did! ,Broakim_Noah\lneh8svvo, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-25 14:00:32, 2019, 2,25, It’s more crowded now.

She still didn't appreciate it. ,Taco-Time\lneh8wghq, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-25 14:53:24, 2019, 2,25, Yeah I can see how that wouldn't be a good idea.

For as many warnings as we heard about it being a horrible route, I drive way worse roads in Michigan every day. ,capthazelwoodsflask\lneh8wcpl, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-25 14:51:56, 2019, 2,25, We had to back up a few times but it wasn't bad.  There wasn't a lot of traffic and usually you could at least see who was coming.  For as tight as the road is there are plenty of spots to pull off on so you can pass.

There was really only one time that it got uncomfortably tight and that was because the person coming the other way didn't know common road courtesy. ,capthazelwoodsflask\lneh9cvc7, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-25 18:11:45, 2019, 2,25, Would not want to make that drive if it was more crowded. ,shortcord\lneh9m776, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-25 19:51:55, 2019, 2,25, The chocolate chip macadamia nut banana bread is really good though.  ,Salty_Pancakes\lnehatp87, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-26 04:41:30, 2019, 2,26, When we pulled up to Julia's there was one car leaving and I think one person drove by as we sat there.  But between the banana bread and the pineapple lemonade I'd imagine that they get some traffic. ,capthazelwoodsflask\lneh9b70r, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-25 17:52:57, 2019, 2,25, iphone xs max :) ,thankssoymatcha\lneh98rg8, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-25 17:25:02, 2019, 2,25, Did the drive in 2010, it was pleasant until we reached Kahakuloa, then the road narrowed. Passing wasn't an issue until we encountered a very large rescue vehicle, now that was stressful, think I got the car up to about a 30 degree angle on the side of the cutout so they could have enough space to pass. We met them in just about the worst spot, they were obviously in a rush to assist somebody and there was nowhere for either of us to safely backup to any usable pulloff. Everyone was very courteous to be fair but I was very relieved that we weren't the vehicle on the drop off side of the road. ,im_on_the_case\lneha5hwm, eh8kjj4, aujxyb,2019-02-25 23:28:20, 2019, 2,25, Yep. ,couldwouldashoulda\lneh8xdsy, eh8r5cy, aujxyb,2019-02-25 15:06:16, 2019, 2,25, Which company please? ,digitalcriminal\lneh8xcdt, eh8r5cy, aujxyb,2019-02-25 15:05:42, 2019, 2,25, Is that hotel Wailea?

Stayed there last June for about a week. We spent a few hungover mornings at the poolside bar. James makes a great bloody Mary to fix that though.
Highly recommend going to the Kihei Cafe for breakfast one day, pinapple and coconut french toast was to die for. 
The road to Hana drive was probably my favorite experience of the whole trip. Tons of beautiful stops but do not underestimate the time it takes. I would expect to spend an entire day making the full trip. We left later then we planned and ended up having to drive back early to make our reservations at Spago at the Four Seasons. 
One more great place to eat is Ferrarro's at the Four Seasons. Great food with a spectacular view of the sunset in an open outdoor patio. After dinner you can even walk down to the beach and have a nice walk and just take in the beauty of the place. 
Enjoy your trip with your wife! ,f-nm\lneh9zunv, eh8r5cy, aujxyb,2019-02-25 22:19:18, 2019, 2,25, Wow thank you so much for the recommendations!! ,MattTooth\lneh8t3dj, eh8ondz, aujxyb,2019-02-25 14:03:53, 2019, 2,25, Hey, enjoy your trip!

Quite comical when two amateurs driving 10 person vans come face to face. I was in a Chevy Sonic following a Miata about two weeks ago and we were having a great time. Until we got behind a van.

Beautiful drive. Way less crowded than Hana. ,Yada_Gaijin\lneh9g0wn, eh8u7a6, aujxyb,2019-02-25 18:46:07, 2019, 2,25, I didn’t notice any warnings, and the road wasn’t too rough just tight in some places ,thankssoymatcha\lneh9c02a, eh90y95, aujxyb,2019-02-25 18:02:03, 2019, 2,25, I highly recommend this drive!

They're a five or six hour flight to the nearest US city.  
2. Time zone differences that cause isolation. Five hour difference to the east coast of the US and two hours to the West coast.  16 hours to China or 8 depending on how you think of it. 10 hours to London. Hard to really stay in touch with business if you're asleep when a lot of major decisions are being made.  
3. The islands are relatively small. They're each incredibly beautiful, but what the people who grew up there say is that you can only drive the same stretch of road so many times before it wears on you. Certain places will probably never get old though.   ,SleepyFarts\lneh8pp26, eh8npz9, aujxyb,2019-02-25 13:05:57, 2019, 2,25, Tons of people move every year after visiting for vacation.

Vacationing you there for fun, focusing on enjoyment, splurging on things, ignoring the negative aspects, eating out all the time, etc.  Living there you're dealing with traffic, tourists, crowds, everyday errands, homeless, rundown infrastructure, everyday high costs, long term isolation.  Rarely does any longtime local overhype Hawaii or enamored by "paradise", it just is.  In fact, there has been an overall population decrease in the past few years, domestically even longer than that. ,mxg67\lneh8yeo4, eh8npz9, aujxyb,2019-02-25 15:19:58, 2019, 2,25, I fuckin' love Hawaii. But not everybody loves the lifestyle. You're definitely less connected there than you are in say LA or New York. I'm more of a small town kinda guy, so for me, Hawaii is the perfect mix of tropical, low-key, outdoorsy & relaxation. But for people who like city life, Hawaii really isn't that for the most part. ,3irhead\lneh99zr4, eh8npz9, aujxyb,2019-02-25 17:39:23, 2019, 2,25, There are rich high profile people living on Maui oprah owns a shit ton of land. Woody harrison owns property also. Steve tyler owns a beach front. Kelsi grammer owns a property on kapulua golf course. And of course good old willie nelson got a nice property also.

But in fact alot of rich folk live on maui. We call them part time residents. Only live there maybe a 1-3 months of the year. They buy up land and build houses, which in turn making the housing market unaffordable for local residents.  ,-xMaverickx-\lnehao0gp, eh8npz9, aujxyb,2019-02-26 03:24:55, 2019, 2,26, It’s so small that it gets boring quickly.

Pay is usually lower here than the salary for equivalent jobs on the mainland. Jobs are scarce and demand is high, obviously, so more people are willing to accept lower pay for a chance to live in Hawaii. For the locals who already live here, though? This sucks. Many have to work 2-3 jobs just to put food on the table. That is just the tip of the iceberg. We have a huge homelessness problem as well, a big part of it stemming from what I just mentioned above. Not trying to put a damper on things on purpose, but that's our reality, and I don't want anyone moving here with those rose-tinted glasses still on.

tldr: There is not enough room or resources for everyone, so please take a vacation here first and don't just spontaneously move here. ,SarcasticMethod\lneh94w62, eh8npz9, aujxyb,2019-02-25 16:40:07, 2019, 2,25, No there are like none.

And they pay generously to keep you there  ,Yotsubato\lneh8zad5, eh8npz9, aujxyb,2019-02-25 15:31:20, 2019, 2,25, I don’t know about a lot, but there definitely are jobs in that range for people with education and a few years of experience. Especially in the medical, electrical/mechanical engineering, and IT to an extent. 

Of course people shouldn’t expect to just move over without a plan or job lined up. I’d imagine the best thing to do is get experience on the mainland for a few years while continuously applying for jobs in Hawaii.  ,KauaiMaui1\lneh9anzf, eh8npz9, aujxyb,2019-02-25 17:47:01, 2019, 2,25, In hospitality.

Nevermind that there are nonstops from New Orleans to London and Frankfurt but not Honolulu.

Still funny to think that being somewhat in the middle of the US, Europe is closer than Hawaii.  True, but not immediately evident unless you pull out a map. ,Apptubrutae\lneh9zmfz, eh8npz9, aujxyb,2019-02-25 22:16:40, 2019, 2,25, LMAO GOOD 1 SO ORIGINAL ,jollybrick\lneh9hqhk, eh8npz9, aujxyb,2019-02-25 19:04:19, 2019, 2,25, Don't really need AC here.

I always figured that places like Hawaii would end up attracting so many people that the native born locals would end up getting screwed.  

I’m not against people moving to where they want to live.  Everyone should be able to live where they love.  But that doesn’t change the reality that it will change the place they love when so many other people are moving there as well. ,Seth_Mimik\lneh93b5s, eh8npz9, aujxyb,2019-02-25 16:21:09, 2019, 2,25, Also, quite possibly folks willing to move here for lower pay keeps salary low and prevents locals from getting higher pay.

Some of the places I went like Twin Falls are a bit muddy right now, although they probably started to dry up by now. If you want to escape huge crowds do the drive around the north shore, but beware the road gets narrow and difficult when there is oncoming traffic. You can always just go up to where the road is still two lanes and get awesome views. If you do that drive there are tons of cool places to stop like Julia’s (the best banana bread).

Travelling solo can be awesome because you get to do what you want.  ,thankssoymatcha\lnehauizl, ehaj2lb, aujxyb,2019-02-26 04:54:11, 2019, 2,26, Spend some time in Wailuku.  It's still kind of 'old Hawaii' plus they have some neat stores.  It's on the way to Iao Valley, which you should also check out.  We stayed our last night with a local couple who were AirBnBing out a room in their house and he showed us around.  Ba-Le is great if you want cheap Vietnamese/French food.

If you like nature/history there are petroglyphs in Olowalu and at Nu'u preserve.  Also, Leoda's in Olowalu has amazing pie.

There wasn't a lot of traffic and usually you could at least see who was coming.  For as tight as the road is there are plenty of spots to pull off on so you can pass.

There was really only one time that it got uncomfortably tight and that was because the person coming the other way didn't know common road courtesy. ,capthazelwoodsflask\lneh98rg8, eh8uuyj, aujxyb,2019-02-25 17:25:02, 2019, 2,25, Did the drive in 2010, it was pleasant until we reached Kahakuloa, then the road narrowed.

Stayed there last June for about a week. We spent a few hungover mornings at the poolside bar. James makes a great bloody Mary to fix that though.
Highly recommend going to the Kihei Cafe for breakfast one day, pinapple and coconut french toast was to die for. 
The road to Hana drive was probably my favorite experience of the whole trip. Tons of beautiful stops but do not underestimate the time it takes. I would expect to spend an entire day making the full trip. We left later then we planned and ended up having to drive back early to make our reservations at Spago at the Four Seasons. 
One more great place to eat is Ferrarro's at the Four Seasons. Great food with a spectacular view of the sunset in an open outdoor patio. After dinner you can even walk down to the beach and have a nice walk and just take in the beauty of the place.

Pay is usually lower here than the salary for equivalent jobs on the mainland. Jobs are scarce and demand is high, obviously, so more people are willing to accept lower pay for a chance to live in Hawaii. For the locals who already live here, though? This sucks. Many have to work 2-3 jobs just to put food on the table. That is just the tip of the iceberg. We have a huge homelessness problem as well, a big part of it stemming from what I just mentioned above. Not trying to put a damper on things on purpose, but that's our reality, and I don't want anyone moving here with those rose-tinted glasses still on.

tldr: There is not enough room or resources for everyone, so please take a vacation here first and don't just spontaneously move here. ,SarcasticMethod\lneh94w62, eh8utkn, aujxyb,2019-02-25 16:40:07, 2019, 2,25, No there are like none.

Especially in the medical, electrical/mechanical engineering, and IT to an extent. 

Of course people shouldn’t expect to just move over without a plan or job lined up. I’d imagine the best thing to do is get experience on the mainland for a few years while continuously applying for jobs in Hawaii.  ,KauaiMaui1\lneh9anzf, eh8utkn, aujxyb,2019-02-25 17:47:01, 2019, 2,25, In hospitality.

I’m not against people moving to where they want to live.  Everyone should be able to live where they love.

Pay is usually lower here than the salary for equivalent jobs on the mainland. Jobs are scarce and demand is high, obviously, so more people are willing to accept lower pay for a chance to live in Hawaii. For the locals who already live here, though? This sucks. Many have to work 2-3 jobs just to put food on the table. That is just the tip of the iceberg. We have a huge homelessness problem as well, a big part of it stemming from what I just mentioned above. Not trying to put a damper on things on purpose, but that's our reality, and I don't want anyone moving here with those rose-tinted glasses still on.

tldr: There is not enough room or resources for everyone, so please take a vacation here first and don't just spontaneously move here. ,SarcasticMethod\lneh94w62, eh8wtpk, aujxyb,2019-02-25 16:40:07, 2019, 2,25, No there are like none. Unless you work in healthcare, then there’s a huge demand for nurses, techs, and doctors. And they pay generously to keep you there  ,Yotsubato\lneh8zad5, eh8wtpk, aujxyb,2019-02-25 15:31:20, 2019, 2,25, I don’t know about a lot, but there definitely are jobs in that range for people with education and a few years of experience. Especially in the medical, electrical/mechanical engineering, and IT to an extent. 

Of course people shouldn’t expect to just move over without a plan or job lined up. I’d imagine the best thing to do is get experience on the mainland for a few years while continuously applying for jobs in Hawaii.  ,KauaiMaui1\lneh9anzf, eh8wtpk, aujxyb,2019-02-25 17:47:01, 2019, 2,25, In hospitality.

I always figured that places like Hawaii would end up attracting so many people that the native born locals would end up getting screwed.  

I’m not against people moving to where they want to live.  Everyone should be able to live where they love.  But that doesn’t change the reality that it will change the place they love when so many other people are moving there as well. ,Seth_Mimik\lneh93b5s, eh8wtpk, aujxyb,2019-02-25 16:21:09, 2019, 2,25, Also, quite possibly folks willing to move here for lower pay keeps salary low and prevents locals from getting higher pay.

Interesting destination.  ,Sheepofwallstreet11\lnehaihvj, eh9m3qk, aulzt6,2019-02-26 02:16:09, 2019, 2,26, I'm not there now.. the trip was back in September 2015 during a period of quiet in the violence there.  We really didn't get to see too much of the town itself but did get out to see the Falls, which were impressive.  Definitely a poor country though.  MOCAF beer was drinkable. ,valeyard89\lnehaimds, eh9neke, aulzt6,2019-02-26 02:17:40, 2019, 2,26, We were just there a couple of days. Flew in and out from Douala to Bangui, and went up to Boali Falls.  Originally had planned to go to Sangha National Park but they lost electricity for a few weeks while we were planning the trip (didn't hear back from them) and had to switch to the backup plan of Bangui area only.  We were there in 2015, just a few months before the Pope visited.

Our most expensive night was for sure the Wilhelm Tell boat in Lucerne. Was like 80 francs per person for a fairly standard fondue meal. ,swollencornholio\lneh96an5, eh8ug3l, aukn0e,2019-02-25 16:56:19, 2019, 2,25, We ate at the self service restaurant there.

Sofia has its charm, and Rila Monastery is a must see if you're there, but Plovdiv is really cool. The Old Town area has an ancient Roman theater you can walk through. There is an area called "The Trap" near the old town that has some cool small bars. I also recommend walking up Bunarjik Hill to see the Alyosha Monument. It offers a great sweeping view of the city from up top. ,Unclemayar\lneh96533, eh94sul, aun427,2019-02-25 16:54:34, 2019, 2,25, eh. there is a lot of who the fuck goes to bulgaria, but i personally wouldn't call it an adventure. but it's definitely not like being in france. it's a typical former eastern block country with the good and bad aspects. there is a lot of beauty and some interesting history. plovdiv is the oldest city in europe and pretty much anyone going from europe to the ME had to pass through there. there are roman ruins, etc. there is good hiking in some areas, rila monastery is nice. hot springs, etc. but it's not like you're going to be driving off into the middle of nowhere never to be seen again. :) ,wanderingdev\lneh9bflh, eh94sul, aun427,2019-02-25 17:55:37, 2019, 2,25, >On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the "adventure" aspect of the country...with 1 being, "Oh, it's just like being in France with with a different alphabet" and 10 being, "Holy fucking shit!

3 or 4.

It's a rather safe country with enough English and tourists as well as travel infrastructure that it's easy to travel and get around.

It's also been part of the western hemisphere of influence that it doesn't feel very Eastern-y anymore. ,Sheepofwallstreet11\lneh95col, eh94sul, aun427,2019-02-25 16:45:31, 2019, 2,25, France is bloody rich compared to Bulgaria.

I guess I'm more so referring to the challenge level. 

For example, when I was in Russia in 2001, you really felt like you were in a different fucking place and that figuring out how shit worked and where to go and whatnot was half of the fun. I found Russia to be so different that when I left and went to Latvia, Latvia felt like the United States in comparison.

The number one purpose of this trip is to spend quality time with a very old and dear friend - but part of the purpose is to introduce him to the way I like to travel and live...but in a slightly watered down form. I don't want us to go to Germany, for example, where we'd have fun but there's no real challenge.

Expensive isn't a big deal as we'll be splitting costs and money won't be an issue for my buddy.

i would recommend sarajevo if you've not been. it's my favorite city in the region. ,wanderingdev\lneh99aa5, eh96a3o, aun427,2019-02-25 17:31:12, 2019, 2,25, I bet you could link the three with a cruise! ,CheeseWheels38\lneh9cdjg, eh96a3o, aun427,2019-02-25 18:06:19, 2019, 2,25, FWIW, i'm planning on buying a condo in bulgaria this summer. ;) ,wanderingdev\lneh9bhg1, eh96a3o, aun427,2019-02-25 17:56:12, 2019, 2,25, >Have you been to Croatia?

Go to Turkey - Greece - Albania ,Sheepofwallstreet11\lneh9y5d6, eh96a3o, aun427,2019-02-25 21:59:46, 2019, 2,25, Croatia is great ,mk262\lneha7t3f, eh96a3o, aun427,2019-02-25 23:58:49, 2019, 2,25, Do you think Croatia and Greece are going to be as touristy if we go inland and aren't doing so much of the coastal stuff?

Expensive isn't a big deal as we'll be splitting costs and money won't be an issue for my buddy. I mean, he's not paying my way or anything but this could very well be a once-in-a-lifetime thing that we get to do together so within reason cost isn't a big factor. ,Oax_Mike\lneh99dxh, eh96a3o, aun427,2019-02-25 17:32:25, 2019, 2,25, it would be pretty hard to link bulgaria with a cruise to greece and croatia, but croatia and greece, definitely.

Thanks to turbulence, you'd definitely need to buckle yourself to the bed so you don't break your nose on the bunk above you, but other than that, It sounds doable. ,garbagecrap\lnehaenjj, ehad14m, austi1,2019-02-26 01:28:29, 2019, 2,26, What safety issues would a bunk bed have that the pre-existing 1st/Biz class lay flat seats don't have? ,netllama\lnehae2s8, ehad14m, austi1,2019-02-26 01:21:27, 2019, 2,26, There have been some patents in the last few years specifically for bunk type accommodations on planes but beyond airlines getting a patent, I don't think any have had orders for planes with that feature.  ,jadeoracle\lnehasm5g, ehad14m, austi1,2019-02-26 04:25:22, 2019, 2,26, Falling from a height.

Going in August this year :). I leave in 2 weeks for my 5-6 month trip and I'll be finishing it in Egypt hitting up all 3 of those cities. Also look into Alexandria and a town on the red sea I believe it's called for some of the best snorkeling in the world. 

Egypt is relatively safe these days. Of course there was a terrorist attack a month or two ago, which did in fact target tourists but it's not a common.  ,SorrowsSkills\lneh9q12g, eh8q0pi, auinrr,2019-02-25 20:31:56, 2019, 2,25, Thanks!

I'm hoping to try as many as possible. ,onelittleworld\lnehapko0, eh8e8mq, auinrr,2019-02-26 03:44:17, 2019, 2,26, I really want to explore Israel as well. I'm really fascinated with all of the MENA countries. I also want to venture into Palestine a bit too. Hope some day they can resolve their issues, though seems unlikely. 

Currently Iceland is the only country I've been to outside of Canada and I went about six months ago for 2 weeks and I hitchhiked around the island. Iceland is one of those countries that no matter how good you are at shoestring travel it will cost quite a bit. I personally wouldn't go back to Iceland without renting a car haha, but most people wouldn't either :P. If you can afford to I'd really suggest spending 2 full weeks in Iceland and renting a car. There's just SO MUCH natural beauty to see. The foods nothing to write home about though. 

I'm Canadian and I'm a bit disappointed at how little I've explored Canada so far :(. We live in such a beautiful country. I'd love to one day get the chance to explore our territories. We really have some great national parks up north, sadly a lot of them are really remote and hence very difficult to get to. Some of them you need to fly to get into the national park lol.  ,SorrowsSkills\lneharz6r, eh8e8mq, auinrr,2019-02-26 04:16:00, 2019, 2,26, I'm Canadian too and I want to visit every province and even the territories some day.

I still haven't been to Newfoundland lol.

Someday I'd love to get out to northern Nunavut for some of the national parks up there but man it's difficult lol. Sooo remote. ,SorrowsSkills\lnehagyio, eh8h53c, auinrr,2019-02-26 01:57:09, 2019, 2,26, 
Just did Amazon last year and was surprised at how accessible it was,  I always figured it was like a 2-3 grand minimum type thing and multi week commitment.

It wasn't until a trip to Colombia with some buddies that I realized I could just fly into Leticia and then make my way in from there. Granted i was just nibbling at the edges of what's available, but still, was nice to at least familiarize myself for next time ,UncleGrga\lnehaso1z, eh8h53c, auinrr,2019-02-26 04:26:08, 2019, 2,26, I realllllly want to visit Patagonia. Could probably spend months there and not get tired of the incredible scenery man. That's definitely on my list. Himalayas is something I forgot to mention in my post! Hoping to travel to Nepal within the next few years to do Everest base camp, perhaps ABC base camp or 1 or 2 smaller treks. I think it'd be an incredible experience and the small bridges over canyons look incredible in all of the pictures for the Everest base camp haha. 

I had to look up what Virunga was but after doing so I'm pleasantly surprised. Based off a quick google search that looks beautiful. Definitely doesn't see a lot of tourism though, especially compared to national parks in neighboring Uganda which seem to have nothing compared to Virunga! Must be because of the instability in Congo. I again had to look up what Serengeti was but again pleasantly surprised :o. 

Again had to look up Omo valley lol, seems like I should educate myself a bit more on African sites. Is Omo valley about the local tribes? I assume so based off of google images and that's pretty intense. That's people look badass. How difficult is it to visit there and how safe? I've seen a couple travel vlogs in Ethiopia and it seems a lot of the country is fairly safe to travel in but I would imagine that the farther you go into remote areas the more dangerous it gets, especially when possibly interacting with local tribes who may not see foreigners (especially white..) very often. 

Antarctica will cost ya quite a bit but that's truly the trip of a lifetime. What do you think about visiting Greenland? 

You're really making me lookup a lot of new places... I'm loving it haha. Kamchatka peninsula looks INCREDIBLE. That's the sort of scenery I absolutely LOVE. Mountains and lakes are just the most beautiful sites to see in my opinion. That peninsula sort of reminds me of northern Canada, particularly northern Nunavut. 

I would definitely loved to visit the salt flats in Bolivia as well, though to be quite honest I'd like to visit everywhere in South America haha.

For northern lights you should look into northern Canada as we recently finished a road that leads you all the way up to the Arctic ocean which I imagine would be a great spot for finding the northern lights. Greenland and Iceland would also be ideal but more expensive than Canada for sure. I'd highly recommend a two week trip to Iceland if you get the chance :P, it has some incredible scenery and a lot of it is actually fairly easy to reach, though that leads way to a boatload of tourists as well sadly. 

I definitely want to see a ton of US National parks as well. I'm hoping next year to go on a 6 month road trip from eastern Canada to west down into the US and back. Washington, Oregon, northern Montana, Utah and Colorado seem to have a ton of the best national parks in the US, also California too but I won't be able to make it that far south on my trip :P. 

> Countries: Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Colombia, Spain, Portugal, Ghana, Senegal, Iran, Uzbekistan, Australia, Greece, Turkey, Bosnia, Ukraine 

In two weeks I'm off to Portugal, then to Spain and two months later to Turkey haha. Really excited for Spain and Turkey personally. Incredible cities like Segovia, Toledo, Seville, Malaga, Granada, Seville, Alanya, Anatalya, Side and so many more incredible cities! If you ever get the chance make sure to explore northern Spain and especially northern Turkey on the black sea. I hear it's incredible!

I'm also very surprised to see Uzbekistan on your life! It's such an unknown country. I really want to do a road trip similar to the mongol rally so I can really explore central Asia in depth. My ideal road trip would be something like this: buy a car somewhere in Europe then drive to northern Turkey>Georgia>Armenia (depending how this effects future visas), Azerbaijan, cross into Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan (if the visa situation eases up), cross back into Russia and finally into Mongolia. Spending 6-8 months on this trip would be ideal for me lol. It'd be a longggg trip but probably rather inexpensive still given how cheap all of those countries are. 

&#x200B;

Ha thanks for the long list to comment on :), I learned about a lot of new places thanks to you!

&#x200B; ,SorrowsSkills\lnehat4xn, eh8k8hb, auinrr,2019-02-26 04:33:01, 2019, 2,26, Hoping to do some treks in Nepal and Everest base camp is one of the them :)! Ideally I'd spend upwards of a month trekking in Nepal and exploring the cities/towns. 

Pfft google says it's only -21 in Yakutsk right now. Those are fairly rookie numbers if you ask me... must be a warmer day for them right now.. ,SorrowsSkills\lnehat84v, eh8eg07, auinrr,2019-02-26 04:34:20, 2019, 2,26, Iceland is the only country I've been to so far. I spent 2 weeks hitchhiking around the island and it was great, though I must admit I'd never visit again without my own car haha. If you can afford it I would highly recommend spending two full weeks in Iceland. Two weeks is a great amount of time to get to see as much as possible! ,SorrowsSkills\lnehaq5ou, eh8fs64, auinrr,2019-02-26 03:51:46, 2019, 2,26, Ah man I'd love to thoroughly explore South America too. Same for Africa haha. I'm lucky and I speak... some French so visiting francophone Africa would be significantly easier for me than most, though I'm sure even English would suffice, as it does everywhere. 

I'm finishing my 6 month trip (that I leave for in 2 weeks :D) in Egypt. I've heard mixed opinions from people but I think it'll be great. The safety situation is pretty stable these days, though unfortunately there was a terrorist attack specifically targeting tourists on the way to the pyramids (bus drove over a landmine or something) but that's not common so I won't let one negative thing stop me from visiting a country. Egypt is basically as cheap as it's ever been too so I'd suggest visiting soon if you get the chance!

If you're looking to see the northern lights try Iceland if you can afford it. Two weeks in Iceland with a rental vehicle and you won't regret it, that is if you can afford it :P. Otherwise perhaps consider northern Canada for the northern lights. We have a road that goes all the way up to the Arctic ocean now and I imagine that'd be a great place for seeing the northern lights. 

&#x200B;

I'd also love to visit Iran and Tibet. I've heard the hospitality in Iran is insane. So much history as well and it's actually not as strict of a country as people think. The government may have strict laws but the younger citizens (which is the majority of the population) follow those laws very loosely lol. Also Iran is still to date one of the safer countries to visit which is a surprise to anyone who's ever looked at western media lol.  ,SorrowsSkills\lnehatcl1, eh8owsr, auinrr,2019-02-26 04:36:13, 2019, 2,26, >Completed most of my bucket list in the last few years but two main ones remaining are spending a few months traveling the Pacific North West USA and up across into Canada.

My friends dad actually works and lives in Doha, Qatar. I hear it's a great city! Perhaps look into Oman as well if you're ever in the region. Oman is a bit more 'authentic' compared to Doha, Kuwait City, Dubai, etc. Still fun cities to visit nonetheless.

My "would like to's" would be switzerland, belgium, vienna and auschwitz.

Would Madrid to rome then fly  to budapest, prague, amsterdam, belgium, and paris be impossible? I would have MAYBE 20 days to do the above mentioned Must haves.

Also would you recomend eurail for this (400 usd for a 10 day global pass)  or separate plane flights?

Also what about airbnb in these locations? I prefer to stay in a cheap hotel or airbnb (thinking no more than 50 bucks a night preferably less)  and I don't want to stay in hostels.

Besides plane flights and lodging how much would you safely budget for food, and spending money?

Thanks again. ,will70723\lneh8jtv5, eh8g32w, auizqx,2019-02-25 10:47:58, 2019, 2,25, I think you've set yourself an almost impossible target here. You've got a load of capital cities where accommodation and food isn't cheap and you're trying to do it for $50 a night but no hostels! You may be able to find some rooms on Airbnb but they may be a way out from the tourist sites and main terminals. I think if you want to do things on a budget then you'd need to trim back on the destinations to save on flight and train costs and give yourself time and money back to maybe get a place a littler out of the centre where you can self cater to save some cash by eating a big breakfast before you go out for the day and to take a little snack with you to keep you going.
All those cities will be really expensive especially all around the tourist sites. Paris and London are both really expensive. Rome and Madrid a little less so but still not cheap. I think you should prioritise what things you want to see in each location and give them a score of importance to give that location a total must see score. Then try and roughly work out how many days you'd need there to see that stuff. How much it will roughly cost you to get there, by train or by plane, find out some rough accommodation costs, look up some average costs for food and drink whilst there and so each place then has a rough cost to get there and stay there and you can budget them up. You can then decide which places don't give you enough for the money and cut them out. Personally I'm less of a fan of the capital cities, they're nothing like the country itself. They're capitals and are generally big, busy, noisy international cities full of tourists seeing the same sights and after all that bustle it's just not that relaxing. If you stay just outside the centre in a quiet neighborhood you'll get a better feel for living there at least, find your own local spots like a nice quiet square to sit in and have a drink and watch the locals go about their lives. The centre of Rome was like Disneyland with selfie sticks, it was nothing like Italy which I love it's relaxed vibe. The Vatican was like a massive queuing system at a fairground with big security gates and scanners, fences, guides and touts and the blending of mass tourism, religious fervour and capitalism was incredibly strange. Expensive tickets, big queues and people were then taking selfies inside with the mummified popes in their glass cases! Very odd, not the solemn spiritual or reverent experience I was expecting and to be honest I was expecting the inside to be more unique inside but I've seen a lot of cathedrals and churches all around Europe and it didn't really stand out for me. It's obviously hugely symbolic but I think you get that from seeing the spectacle of the outside with the big square and whole religious district its in than seeing inside. The tour of St Paul's cathedral in London has more stuff to see I think with the climb up to the huge dome and the famous people interred in the basement. Lot smaller queues as well and just as impressive a space inside. Good audio tour to do.
One thing I would add is that Milan has a tradition of giving free food in bars around 5pm. They expect you to get a drink but the drinks are cheap there and the food is pretty good and filling. It's kind of a hot and cold buffet at the bar with pasta and stuff. That can be a good way of enjoying time with locals in a normal bar and saving some money. It's also relatively close to Verona, the lakes and Venice which are all really nice places to visit and see more authentic Italian cities, ok maybe not so much Venice, that's a bit of a Disney ride as well but it's pretty unique and it's probably not going to be around forever.
Amsterdam is another busy tourist city. I'd suggest Utrecht which is the second biggest city and a short 35mins by train. It's like a mini Amsterdam with gorgeus canals and cobbled streets with lots of flowers, it's easy to hire a bike or little boat to explore and there are loads of lovely bars and cafes by the canals or squares to sit and watch the world go by and it's a lot less abrasive and packed with rowdy drunk tourists than Amsterdam is. Yet if you want to see all of that it's close enough to take the train there.
I'd always suggest to avoid the main capitals and to stay outside and do day trips in to see what sites you want to see. Capitals are always the tourist trap where you pay more for less. Smaller cities are often better and more unique memorable experiences where you're not just taking the same photos you've seen millions of times already. You're more likely to be surprised by something or to not have any pre conceived expectations so you're less likely to be disappointed by the reality.
It sounds like an awesome long holiday though so I hope you get it all worked out and have a great time. ,Motchan13\lneh8k5oi, eh8g32w, auizqx,2019-02-25 10:57:44, 2019, 2,25, I appreciate this response as well. I will look into "alternate cities" in these countries that I want to see. As well as try to come up with another plan to maybe trim some cities down or turn them into smaller cheaper cities. I think I can get all my plane flights down to about 1,200 usd. That includes my flight from san francisco to london, all the short european flights and a flight back from europe to San Francisco. 

My biggest cost besides flights is going to be hotels or airbnb. But I don't have to strict of needs when it comes to lodging. I just need a private room, and somewhat near locations to see. That could be either walking, uber or short bus rides.  I would ultimately like to keep my trip under 2,500 usd but not sure if its possible.  ,will70723\lneh8lqz2, eh8g32w, auizqx,2019-02-25 11:41:27, 2019, 2,25, The 2500 price isn't feasible, it's not even close. Even trying to use cheap transit, flights 
and lodging that will eat up 2500 by itself. What will happen is early on you'll freeze up and youll become apprehensive about your spending habits. Just downsize your inteniary,  I would look into heading into Spain directly, spend some time in Portugal and pick one other destination. Enjoy your time in Europe,  dont try and see all of Europe. ,canucker78\lneh8ynxa, eh8g32w, auizqx,2019-02-25 15:23:18, 2019, 2,25, Really you think 2500 usd isnt do-able? I thought this should be pretty easy. For the week of june 1st to june 8th I'm staying in madrid FORE FREE. Thats lodging and food 100 percent free so thats about 8 days of being in Madrid for free. I should of mentioned that earlier. So that leaves basically my "paid" trip from  June 9th til lets estimate june 25/26. Plus a few days before June 1st when I fly in. 

So far my rough numbers I was able to come up with plane flights $1,150 (that includes plane into europe and plane back to united states plus ALL the quick plane flights of all the cities I have listed in my previous messages (the more cities I cut down on on that $1,150)  that leaves me at least $1,300 to spend on food and lodging (in about  maybe 20 days?) this is all assuming I would hit all those cities. So if I cut it down even more and shorten the trip a little that $1,150 should go down a decent amount as well as hotel/airbnb cost?

&#x200B;

Any advice on where to stay? I heard airbnb you can get decent places on the level of a hotel but with your own place? Would you recommend airbnb over a hotel? Also I could "cheapen" my trip by staying longer at some of these smaller cities and stay at an airbnb longer in these smaller cities?

&#x200B;

Thanks again to everyone. I will take a lot of pics plus i make short documentary/vids I will make sure to post the link to them when I get back from my trip. ,will70723\lneh98zat, eh8g32w, auizqx,2019-02-25 17:27:35, 2019, 2,25, $2500 including transatlantic is 100% not doable. $2500, excluding transatlantic flights, would still be tough. You would have to be smart about where you go (i.e. minimizing travel because of the cost) and where you stay (i.e. hostels). Airbnb is great for groups, since you have more people to spread the costs around, but will not be nearly as economical for a solo traveler. You need to map out a logical route, using resources like booking.com for loding, seat61.com for train info, and google flights for potential flights and see what makes sense with your budget. It also might be better for you to cut down the length of your trip to increase the quality of it, if your budget is that thin.


For reference, I'm going on a ~22 day Europe trip this summer, and my lodging+Europe only travel costs (so not including transatlantic flights) is around $1400. That does not include food, drink, tourist sites, public transport within the cities, or anything else.  ,steeveee12\lneh9e532, eh8g32w, auizqx,2019-02-25 18:25:38, 2019, 2,25, Google flights is where I'm booking my flights from sfo to london ($375/400 usd)

I looked up ryanair and easy jet all the flights in europe were as low as 49 up to 92 usd so add in aprox

 $450 bucks.

&#x200B;

Then the return flight is 400 bucks at most (found a few in mid to lower 300's)

So that roughly puts me at 1100 for complete round trip plus flights in europe.

&#x200B;

I have been able to find airbnb private homes in most cities for 50 bucks and under pretty easy (just depends on picking specific neighborhoods and distance from place) so  $50 a night x roughly 18 days =$900 (I know a few cities will be way less than that from research but wanted to use $50 as the average to play it safe)

**Is there a better option besides airbnb and higher than a hostel?**

&#x200B;

That just leaves food and whatever spending money ( I budget very well and dont blow money on unnecessary things but also will spend a little extra in a couple places)

So realistically speaking without taking out any of the locations ( which I know I'm probably going to have to) that puts me at about $2,100 bucks before food. Now if I cut back on some of the locations that should probably lower me closer to $1,700 or so.  which would leave me about 800 bucks on food and whatever spending money for about 18 days which is do-able with my budgeting.

Or am I missing something? ,will70723\lneh9rg2e, eh8g32w, auizqx,2019-02-25 20:46:44, 2019, 2,25, Nobody here can really help you until you put together a cohesive plan. For example, if youre talking about western capital cities/switzerland/etc then everyone will tell you your budget is nuts. If you put together an itinerary consisting of lower cost options, that's another thing. Go figure out what 4/5 cities (maybe less, maybe more) you want to see in the 18 days you have, and then we can help out some more. ,steeveee12\lneh9teg0, eh8g32w, auizqx,2019-02-25 21:07:47, 2019, 2,25, I would say must have cities would be. Paris, budapest, prague, one of either rome or athens (someone mentioned milan?) amsterdam/belgium area. 

I am fine going to the "bigger expensive" cities for a short amount of time maybe even just a day trip and staying close by in a small town. It's more about exploring and being able to say I been their. 

I would probably spend most of my time in smaller cities like prague, lisbon, budapest where I could have cheaper expenses maybe stay at those places 2-4 days and then the bigger cities maybe 1-2 day trips. 

&#x200B;

I was even debating about taking overnight trains on eurail to "get free" overnight stays without staying a hotel or airbnb a few of the nights. 

Plus I can take ryanair or easy jet to see 1 or 2 countries fairly quick in a day or 2 span which is fine with me.

  
Hopefully this helps.

First thoughts after looking at your list of cities...

Paris/Belgium/Amsterdam are easily connected by train

Prague/Budapest are easily connected by train

Athens and Rome are two major outliers from these other two areas, you would need to fly in and out.

You /could/ train to from Amsterdam-Prague, but its an 11 hour train I believe.

A workable itinerary would be something like:

Fly into Paris-Train to Belgium-Train to Amsterdam-Fly to Prague-Train to Budapest-Fly to Rome

Its pretty busy for 18 days. Lots of people here advocate for slowing down, and they certainly have a point. ,steeveee12\lneh9vwq0, eh8g32w, auizqx,2019-02-25 21:35:03, 2019, 2,25,  

That does help.

First thoughts after looking at your list of cities...

Paris/Belgium/Amsterdam are easily connected by train

**( I was thinking of doing eurail but alot of trains are long cheap air planes seem quicker) but I might combine eurail and easy jet flights?**

Prague/Budapest are easily connected by train

**( I would probably stay in this region longer then bigger cities because of price and make little day trips to surrounding countries here.)**

Athens and Rome are two major outliers from these other two areas, you would need to fly in and out.

**(This is where I would start to use ryanair or easy jet probably from madrid to rome or madrid to athens which then I would take another cheap fight from either rome or athens up to budapest before using trains in that region.)**

You /could/ train to from Amsterdam-Prague, but its an 11 hour train I believe.

**( I would probably pass on train this way too long and take a cheap flight, at this point I'm wondering if a eurail pass would even be worth it for me? since I would be taking a lot of cheap flights)**

A workable itinerary would be something like:

Fly into Paris-Train to Belgium-Train to Amsterdam-Fly to Prague-Train to Budapest-Fly to Rome

**( I planned on flying from sfo to london spending a day or 2 there to get it off my checklist. Then taking a plane from london to lisbon or madrid spending 3-5 days there before my obligations in madrid that start go from June 1st-8th. So after the 8th I looked at it geography wise and was either going to fly to paris and go paris-amsterdam- prauge - budapest that direction. Or the complete opposite from madrid-rome-budapest-prague-amsterdam-and then paris.)**

Its on the busier side for 18 days. Lots of people here advocate for slowing down, and they certainly have a point. ,will70723\lnehaydc0, ehaxrbe, auizqx,2019-02-26 06:03:17, 2019, 2,26, Thanks yea I think I'm going to try to narrow it down to about 6/7 cities. It's hard because I want to see so much stuff. Because honestly I don't know when I will ever have the time or opportunity again.  I guess my highlights would be split into 2 sections  areas I could train to (  budapest, prague, vienna and then on western europe paris, amsterdam and belgium. Those might be my highlights. I am lucky enough to have about a week before staying in spain that I can land into london and stay there for 2/3 days and get that off my checklist. So I guess  my cities that I either have to leave out or figure out how to squeeze them in to an already croweded 6 cities would be rome, switzerland and possibly parts of germany. 

Hopefully this is possible. ,will70723\lneh8hcdz, eh8go91, auizqx,2019-02-25 09:30:57, 2019, 2,25, Definitely something I was thinking about when you mentioned flights. I checked out ryanair I believe it was. I just heard that train might take longer but counting check in time and getting to airport it usually doesn't save much time? But if I do go the flight route would you recommend not buying the eurail pass? I looked up flights through several of these countries the other day (mostly between 50-100 usd ) to places like madrid to rome or athens to budapest or even prague to paris.

&#x200B;

So if airlines are cheaper, and faster I could definitely switch it up and go the flying method over the eurail. I just liked how easy, included and location centered eurail is. Plus might be able to see a lot of sites on the train ride and get some sleep instead of paying for hotels a few nights on overnight trains.

&#x200B;

And I'm youngish 37 so I do want to hit up a few tourist spots (museums, Eiffel tower, buckingham palace, coliseum ) but also would like to find a few local chill spots in some of the bigger and smaller cities (in prague, budapest lisbon madrid) to save money, see the culture, and try new foods. So I'm literally up for anything. I would describe my ideal vacation as being the "best value" which I would say includes overall money, less travel time, best sites to see, and memorable experience.

&#x200B;

Basically have 20 days for these places ( 32 days in total when you count flying into london and madrid for 8 days before heading out to these places) I would like to get away with doing 2 days in most cities and probably 3 days in paris, rome, prague maybe amsterdam or amsterdamn and surrounding cities. Possible or too short? ,will70723\lneh8ohtb, eh8go91, auizqx,2019-02-25 12:42:42, 2019, 2,25, The best thing about this is the fact you consider yourself on the young side - it's more common that people think they're too old to travel at 25 when they obviously are not. 

The real problems are elsewhere. First off, you appear to have have too many places on your list. You'll be spending too much time in transit and will end up seeing rather little once you actually get where you're going. Second, once you narrow down your list of places, check if a rail pass even is worth it - chances are it isn't worth it even with your current plan. Individual train tickets will work fine, particularly when you know when you're going where, but it's up to you to do the maths. Then there's the budget issue - some places are cheaper, like Budapest and Prague, and then if you stop in Switzerland, you'll eat up many Budapest days' worth of budget in no time. If money is tight, go to fewer places and stay longer where it's more affordable.  ,Intup\lnehacn7u, eh8go91, auizqx,2019-02-26 01:03:03, 2019, 2,26, 2 days is way to short and your compounding your costs by constantly traveling. All you'll end up doing is having a meal and maybe taking in a site. Even with proper budgeting you'll encounter situations where you'll take the train from the airport to the city and that will eat half your daily budget. If you were to visit your own country does a plan to visit Seattle, LA, NYC and Miami make much sense?  ,canucker78\lnehae8fv, eh8go91, auizqx,2019-02-26 01:23:23, 2019, 2,26, That makes sense. Everyone says its too much. I guess I want to do and see everything. Just curious what cities or countries on my list could I cut out and probably wouldnt regret it too much or at least get a similar experience somewhere else.
 
I guess I figured too be to advetourous in too short of a time frame. I was thinking I could do 1 week in the paris/amsterdam area. A week in prague/budapest area and rome up to switzerland area. Maybe these 3 overall areas is what I can focus on and maybe trim some cities out.

Edit: I guess I have a bad assumption of hostels maybe for no good reason. Would you guys be fine staying in hostels? Im the type that really likes my own sleeping space though ,will70723\lnehalz67, eh8go91, auizqx,2019-02-26 02:59:35, 2019, 2,26, With 20ish days I would try and pick one side of Europe to focus on. I would do either Rome/Athens then Budapest to Prague by train. Or focus on western Europe doing Paris, Belgium and Amsterdam. You can always come back in the future and see other side.

Your accommodation options will depend on the city and country. Just be diligent and look at each option. 
 ,canucker78\lneh8jtv5, eh8guiw, auizqx,2019-02-25 10:47:58, 2019, 2,25, I think you've set yourself an almost impossible target here. You've got a load of capital cities where accommodation and food isn't cheap and you're trying to do it for $50 a night but no hostels! You may be able to find some rooms on Airbnb but they may be a way out from the tourist sites and main terminals. I think if you want to do things on a budget then you'd need to trim back on the destinations to save on flight and train costs and give yourself time and money back to maybe get a place a littler out of the centre where you can self cater to save some cash by eating a big breakfast before you go out for the day and to take a little snack with you to keep you going.
All those cities will be really expensive especially all around the tourist sites. Paris and London are both really expensive. Rome and Madrid a little less so but still not cheap. I think you should prioritise what things you want to see in each location and give them a score of importance to give that location a total must see score. Then try and roughly work out how many days you'd need there to see that stuff. How much it will roughly cost you to get there, by train or by plane, find out some rough accommodation costs, look up some average costs for food and drink whilst there and so each place then has a rough cost to get there and stay there and you can budget them up. You can then decide which places don't give you enough for the money and cut them out. Personally I'm less of a fan of the capital cities, they're nothing like the country itself. They're capitals and are generally big, busy, noisy international cities full of tourists seeing the same sights and after all that bustle it's just not that relaxing.

Expensive tickets, big queues and people were then taking selfies inside with the mummified popes in their glass cases! Very odd, not the solemn spiritual or reverent experience I was expecting and to be honest I was expecting the inside to be more unique inside but I've seen a lot of cathedrals and churches all around Europe and it didn't really stand out for me.

I would probably spend most of my time in smaller cities like prague, lisbon, budapest where I could have cheaper expenses maybe stay at those places 2-4 days and then the bigger cities maybe 1-2 day trips. 

&#x200B;

I was even debating about taking overnight trains on eurail to "get free" overnight stays without staying a hotel or airbnb a few of the nights. 

Plus I can take ryanair or easy jet to see 1 or 2 countries fairly quick in a day or 2 span which is fine with me.

  
Hopefully this helps.

First thoughts after looking at your list of cities...

Paris/Belgium/Amsterdam are easily connected by train

Prague/Budapest are easily connected by train

Athens and Rome are two major outliers from these other two areas, you would need to fly in and out.

You /could/ train to from Amsterdam-Prague, but its an 11 hour train I believe.

A workable itinerary would be something like:

Fly into Paris-Train to Belgium-Train to Amsterdam-Fly to Prague-Train to Budapest-Fly to Rome

Its pretty busy for 18 days. Lots of people here advocate for slowing down, and they certainly have a point. ,steeveee12\lneh9vwq0, eh8guiw, auizqx,2019-02-25 21:35:03, 2019, 2,25,

First thoughts after looking at your list of cities...

Paris/Belgium/Amsterdam are easily connected by train

**( I was thinking of doing eurail but alot of trains are long cheap air planes seem quicker) but I might combine eurail and easy jet flights?**

Prague/Budapest are easily connected by train

**( I would probably stay in this region longer then bigger cities because of price and make little day trips to surrounding countries here.)**

Athens and Rome are two major outliers from these other two areas, you would need to fly in and out.

**(This is where I would start to use ryanair or easy jet probably from madrid to rome or madrid to athens which then I would take another cheap fight from either rome or athens up to budapest before using trains in that region.)**

You /could/ train to from Amsterdam-Prague, but its an 11 hour train I believe.

**( I would probably pass on train this way too long and take a cheap flight, at this point I'm wondering if a eurail pass would even be worth it for me? since I would be taking a lot of cheap flights)**

A workable itinerary would be something like:

Fly into Paris-Train to Belgium-Train to Amsterdam-Fly to Prague-Train to Budapest-Fly to Rome

**( I planned on flying from sfo to london spending a day or 2 there to get it off my checklist. Then taking a plane from london to lisbon or madrid spending 3-5 days there before my obligations in madrid that start go from June 1st-8th. So after the 8th I looked at it geography wise and was either going to fly to paris and go paris-amsterdam- prauge - budapest that direction. Or the complete opposite from madrid-rome-budapest-prague-amsterdam-and then paris.)**

Its on the busier side for 18 days. Lots of people here advocate for slowing down, and they certainly have a point. ,will70723\lneh8ohtb, eh8hcdz, auizqx,2019-02-25 12:42:42, 2019, 2,25, The best thing about this is the fact you consider yourself on the young side - it's more common that people think they're too old to travel at 25 when they obviously are not. 

The real problems are elsewhere. First off, you appear to have have too many places on your list. You'll be spending too much time in transit and will end up seeing rather little once you actually get where you're going. Second, once you narrow down your list of places, check if a rail pass even is worth it - chances are it isn't worth it even with your current plan. Individual train tickets will work fine, particularly when you know when you're going where, but it's up to you to do the maths. Then there's the budget issue - some places are cheaper, like Budapest and Prague, and then if you stop in Switzerland, you'll eat up many Budapest days' worth of budget in no time. If money is tight, go to fewer places and stay longer where it's more affordable.  ,Intup\lnehacn7u, eh8hcdz, auizqx,2019-02-26 01:03:03, 2019, 2,26, 2 days is way to short and your compounding your costs by constantly traveling. All you'll end up doing is having a meal and maybe taking in a site. Even with proper budgeting you'll encounter situations where you'll take the train from the airport to the city and that will eat half your daily budget. If you were to visit your own country does a plan to visit Seattle, LA, NYC and Miami make much sense?  ,canucker78\lnehae8fv, eh8hcdz, auizqx,2019-02-26 01:23:23, 2019, 2,26, That makes sense. Everyone says its too much. I guess I want to do and see everything. Just curious what cities or countries on my list could I cut out and probably wouldnt regret it too much or at least get a similar experience somewhere else.
 
I guess I figured too be to advetourous in too short of a time frame. I was thinking I could do 1 week in the paris/amsterdam area. A week in prague/budapest area and rome up to switzerland area. Maybe these 3 overall areas is what I can focus on and maybe trim some cities out.

Edit: I guess I have a bad assumption of hostels maybe for no good reason. Would you guys be fine staying in hostels? Im the type that really likes my own sleeping space though ,will70723\lnehalz67, eh8hcdz, auizqx,2019-02-26 02:59:35, 2019, 2,26, With 20ish days I would try and pick one side of Europe to focus on. I would do either Rome/Athens then Budapest to Prague by train. Or focus on western Europe doing Paris, Belgium and Amsterdam. You can always come back in the future and see other side.

Your accommodation options will depend on the city and country. Just be diligent and look at each option. 
 ,canucker78\lneh8k5oi, eh8jtv5, auizqx,2019-02-25 10:57:44, 2019, 2,25, I appreciate this response as well. I will look into "alternate cities" in these countries that I want to see. As well as try to come up with another plan to maybe trim some cities down or turn them into smaller cheaper cities. I think I can get all my plane flights down to about 1,200 usd. That includes my flight from san francisco to london, all the short european flights and a flight back from europe to San Francisco. 

My biggest cost besides flights is going to be hotels or airbnb. But I don't have to strict of needs when it comes to lodging. I just need a private room, and somewhat near locations to see. That could be either walking, uber or short bus rides.  I would ultimately like to keep my trip under 2,500 usd but not sure if its possible.  ,will70723\lneh8lqz2, eh8jtv5, auizqx,2019-02-25 11:41:27, 2019, 2,25, The 2500 price isn't feasible, it's not even close. Even trying to use cheap transit, flights 
and lodging that will eat up 2500 by itself. What will happen is early on you'll freeze up and youll become apprehensive about your spending habits. Just downsize your inteniary,  I would look into heading into Spain directly, spend some time in Portugal and pick one other destination. Enjoy your time in Europe,  dont try and see all of Europe. ,canucker78\lneh8ynxa, eh8jtv5, auizqx,2019-02-25 15:23:18, 2019, 2,25, Really you think 2500 usd isnt do-able? I thought this should be pretty easy. For the week of june 1st to june 8th I'm staying in madrid FORE FREE. Thats lodging and food 100 percent free so thats about 8 days of being in Madrid for free. I should of mentioned that earlier. So that leaves basically my "paid" trip from  June 9th til lets estimate june 25/26. Plus a few days before June 1st when I fly in. 

So far my rough numbers I was able to come up with plane flights $1,150 (that includes plane into europe and plane back to united states plus ALL the quick plane flights of all the cities I have listed in my previous messages (the more cities I cut down on on that $1,150)  that leaves me at least $1,300 to spend on food and lodging (in about  maybe 20 days?) this is all assuming I would hit all those cities. So if I cut it down even more and shorten the trip a little that $1,150 should go down a decent amount as well as hotel/airbnb cost?

&#x200B;

Any advice on where to stay? I heard airbnb you can get decent places on the level of a hotel but with your own place? Would you recommend airbnb over a hotel? Also I could "cheapen" my trip by staying longer at some of these smaller cities and stay at an airbnb longer in these smaller cities?

&#x200B;

Thanks again to everyone. I will take a lot of pics plus i make short documentary/vids I will make sure to post the link to them when I get back from my trip. ,will70723\lneh98zat, eh8jtv5, auizqx,2019-02-25 17:27:35, 2019, 2,25, $2500 including transatlantic is 100% not doable. $2500, excluding transatlantic flights, would still be tough. You would have to be smart about where you go (i.e. minimizing travel because of the cost) and where you stay (i.e. hostels). Airbnb is great for groups, since you have more people to spread the costs around, but will not be nearly as economical for a solo traveler. You need to map out a logical route, using resources like booking.com for loding, seat61.com for train info, and google flights for potential flights and see what makes sense with your budget. It also might be better for you to cut down the length of your trip to increase the quality of it, if your budget is that thin.


For reference, I'm going on a ~22 day Europe trip this summer, and my lodging+Europe only travel costs (so not including transatlantic flights) is around $1400. That does not include food, drink, tourist sites, public transport within the cities, or anything else.  ,steeveee12\lneh9e532, eh8jtv5, auizqx,2019-02-25 18:25:38, 2019, 2,25, Google flights is where I'm booking my flights from sfo to london ($375/400 usd)

I looked up ryanair and easy jet all the flights in europe were as low as 49 up to 92 usd so add in aprox

 $450 bucks.

&#x200B;

Then the return flight is 400 bucks at most (found a few in mid to lower 300's)

So that roughly puts me at 1100 for complete round trip plus flights in europe.

&#x200B;

I have been able to find airbnb private homes in most cities for 50 bucks and under pretty easy (just depends on picking specific neighborhoods and distance from place) so  $50 a night x roughly 18 days =$900 (I know a few cities will be way less than that from research but wanted to use $50 as the average to play it safe)

**Is there a better option besides airbnb and higher than a hostel?**

&#x200B;

That just leaves food and whatever spending money ( I budget very well and dont blow money on unnecessary things but also will spend a little extra in a couple places)

So realistically speaking without taking out any of the locations ( which I know I'm probably going to have to) that puts me at about $2,100 bucks before food. Now if I cut back on some of the locations that should probably lower me closer to $1,700 or so.  which would leave me about 800 bucks on food and whatever spending money for about 18 days which is do-able with my budgeting.

Or am I missing something? ,will70723\lneh9rg2e, eh8jtv5, auizqx,2019-02-25 20:46:44, 2019, 2,25, Nobody here can really help you until you put together a cohesive plan. For example, if youre talking about western capital cities/switzerland/etc then everyone will tell you your budget is nuts. If you put together an itinerary consisting of lower cost options, that's another thing. Go figure out what 4/5 cities (maybe less, maybe more) you want to see in the 18 days you have, and then we can help out some more. ,steeveee12\lneh9teg0, eh8jtv5, auizqx,2019-02-25 21:07:47, 2019, 2,25, I would say must have cities would be.

It also might be better for you to cut down the length of your trip to increase the quality of it, if your budget is that thin.


For reference, I'm going on a ~22 day Europe trip this summer, and my lodging+Europe only travel costs (so not including transatlantic flights) is around $1400. That does not include food, drink, tourist sites, public transport within the cities, or anything else.  ,steeveee12\lneh9e532, eh8lqz2, auizqx,2019-02-25 18:25:38, 2019, 2,25, Google flights is where I'm booking my flights from sfo to london ($375/400 usd)

I looked up ryanair and easy jet all the flights in europe were as low as 49 up to 92 usd so add in aprox

 $450 bucks.

&#x200B;

Then the return flight is 400 bucks at most (found a few in mid to lower 300's)

So that roughly puts me at 1100 for complete round trip plus flights in europe.

&#x200B;

I have been able to find airbnb private homes in most cities for 50 bucks and under pretty easy (just depends on picking specific neighborhoods and distance from place) so  $50 a night x roughly 18 days =$900 (I know a few cities will be way less than that from research but wanted to use $50 as the average to play it safe)

**Is there a better option besides airbnb and higher than a hostel?**

&#x200B;

That just leaves food and whatever spending money ( I budget very well and dont blow money on unnecessary things but also will spend a little extra in a couple places)

So realistically speaking without taking out any of the locations ( which I know I'm probably going to have to) that puts me at about $2,100 bucks before food. Now if I cut back on some of the locations that should probably lower me closer to $1,700 or so.  which would leave me about 800 bucks on food and whatever spending money for about 18 days which is do-able with my budgeting.

Or am I missing something? ,will70723\lneh9rg2e, eh8lqz2, auizqx,2019-02-25 20:46:44, 2019, 2,25, Nobody here can really help you until you put together a cohesive plan. For example, if youre talking about western capital cities/switzerland/etc then everyone will tell you your budget is nuts. If you put together an itinerary consisting of lower cost options, that's another thing. Go figure out what 4/5 cities (maybe less, maybe more) you want to see in the 18 days you have, and then we can help out some more. ,steeveee12\lneh9teg0, eh8lqz2, auizqx,2019-02-25 21:07:47, 2019, 2,25, I would say must have cities would be. Paris, budapest, prague, one of either rome or athens (someone mentioned milan?) amsterdam/belgium area. 

I am fine going to the "bigger expensive" cities for a short amount of time maybe even just a day trip and staying close by in a small town. It's more about exploring and being able to say I been their. 

I would probably spend most of my time in smaller cities like prague, lisbon, budapest where I could have cheaper expenses maybe stay at those places 2-4 days and then the bigger cities maybe 1-2 day trips. 

&#x200B;

I was even debating about taking overnight trains on eurail to "get free" overnight stays without staying a hotel or airbnb a few of the nights. 

Plus I can take ryanair or easy jet to see 1 or 2 countries fairly quick in a day or 2 span which is fine with me.

  
Hopefully this helps.

First thoughts after looking at your list of cities...

Paris/Belgium/Amsterdam are easily connected by train

Prague/Budapest are easily connected by train

Athens and Rome are two major outliers from these other two areas, you would need to fly in and out.

You /could/ train to from Amsterdam-Prague, but its an 11 hour train I believe.

A workable itinerary would be something like:

Fly into Paris-Train to Belgium-Train to Amsterdam-Fly to Prague-Train to Budapest-Fly to Rome

Its pretty busy for 18 days. Lots of people here advocate for slowing down, and they certainly have a point. ,steeveee12\lneh9vwq0, eh8lqz2, auizqx,2019-02-25 21:35:03, 2019, 2,25,

You would have to be smart about where you go (i.e. minimizing travel because of the cost) and where you stay (i.e. hostels). Airbnb is great for groups, since you have more people to spread the costs around, but will not be nearly as economical for a solo traveler. You need to map out a logical route, using resources like booking.com for loding, seat61.com for train info, and google flights for potential flights and see what makes sense with your budget.

That does help.

First thoughts after looking at your list of cities...

Paris/Belgium/Amsterdam are easily connected by train

**( I was thinking of doing eurail but alot of trains are long cheap air planes seem quicker) but I might combine eurail and easy jet flights?**

Prague/Budapest are easily connected by train

**( I would probably stay in this region longer then bigger cities because of price and make little day trips to surrounding countries here.)**

Athens and Rome are two major outliers from these other two areas, you would need to fly in and out.

**(This is where I would start to use ryanair or easy jet probably from madrid to rome or madrid to athens which then I would take another cheap fight from either rome or athens up to budapest before using trains in that region.)**

You /could/ train to from Amsterdam-Prague, but its an 11 hour train I believe.

**( I would probably pass on train this way too long and take a cheap flight, at this point I'm wondering if a eurail pass would even be worth it for me? since I would be taking a lot of cheap flights)**

A workable itinerary would be something like:

Fly into Paris-Train to Belgium-Train to Amsterdam-Fly to Prague-Train to Budapest-Fly to Rome

**( I planned on flying from sfo to london spending a day or 2 there to get it off my checklist. Then taking a plane from london to lisbon or madrid spending 3-5 days there before my obligations in madrid that start go from June 1st-8th. So after the 8th I looked at it geography wise and was either going to fly to paris and go paris-amsterdam- prauge - budapest that direction. Or the complete opposite from madrid-rome-budapest-prague-amsterdam-and then paris.)**

Like I said, I'm 19, and I'm a college kid from California. And like you said, I have zero skills; so what's so despicable about easing myself into such an experience abroad to get a taste of it, rather than be a "real contributor?" Programs like those that companies like IVHQ offer, if nothing else, allow people to get a foot into the door of a life of social service.

So beyond selfies with strangers, do best abstrat photo, best food photo, best cultural photo, best architectural/statue, etc

You could even do it like clues or trivia of places you are going to go to. Like "This famous statue was created by Michelangelo, what is its name?" To make it more educational.

Card games are always a good option for travel days.

I forget what this game is called, but you have a piece of paper, everyone writes a sentence out, then you pass it, and the next person draws the sentence, and then pass it again and the next person writes a sentence about the drawing. Kind of like telephone but with paper.

A drinking game that you could probably turn into a non drinking game is The Captian. Someone is The Captian, and when they freeze in place everyone has to do the exact same thing.

I was holding off on buying the ticket because I didn’t want to get it, only to be denied at the gate for not having a “real” ID.  ,HenryBalzac\lneh9o7lj, eh8ad9i, auhswr,2019-02-25 20:12:57, 2019, 2,25, Your trip is tomorrow but you haven't booked your flight? ,RickyLidz\lneh9oagb, eh8ad9i, auhswr,2019-02-25 20:13:47, 2019, 2,25, Yeah, I wasn’t sure I would be able to get time off from work until yesterday.  ,HenryBalzac\lnehahj20, eh9yr14, auhswr,2019-02-26 02:04:16, 2019, 2,26, YOU ARE CORRECT!! I actually found that out this afternoon. One of my coworkers’ husband is a TSA agent and she gave me that exact same info. Apparently you can also USE you expired passport for that extra year to travel internationally (that’s what she told me, anyway). ,HenryBalzac\lnehaig7o, eh9yr14, auhswr,2019-02-26 02:15:34, 2019, 2,26, > Apparently you can also USE you expired passport for that extra year to travel internationally (that’s what she told me, anyway).

This is not correct. You could potentially use it to return to the US, as it cannot deny a citizen entry, but every other country is more likely than not to refuse you entry. And an airline is unlikely to let you fly there at all. ,Oroso\lnehaikft, eh9yr14, auhswr,2019-02-26 02:17:01, 2019, 2,26, Yeah, I thought that part sounded a little weird.  ,HenryBalzac\lneh8auk4, eh8amrx, auhswr,2019-02-25 06:41:32, 2019, 2,25, >but it probably isn’t

Based on what? People lose their wallets during their trips, leaving them with less than what you have. Domestically, you don't marooned. It's not optimal, but such is the case. If you didn't want to risk it, you should have renewed your passport. ,tariqabjotu\lneh8b6if, eh8amrx, auhswr,2019-02-25 06:48:46, 2019, 2,25, Based on my pessimistic outlook lol

You’re right, though. People lose their wallets. Shit happens! I’m just worried. I’ve never been in this position before, so I’m concerned about the whole thing. Hell, if I get turned away at security, it wouldn’t matter as long as I can get a refund on my ticket. But I’ve always heard that airlines were notorious for not giving refunds. 

Also, I didn’t renew my passport because I haven’t traveled abroad in years and have had no plans on doing so anytime soon, so it was kinda irrelevant. I also didn’t think that it would take this long to get a regular freaking license. Stupid post office!  ,HenryBalzac\lneh8w722, eh8amrx, auhswr,2019-02-25 14:49:42, 2019, 2,25, There is nothing to be worried about! Show up early because you'll be subject to extra security measures, but no ID is required to fly domestic in the US. It would be good to bring along whatever ID you have, but none is required. ,gt_ap\lneh9ochi, eh8amrx, auhswr,2019-02-25 20:14:23, 2019, 2,25, Awesome, thanks!! ,HenryBalzac\lneh9o7lj, eh8aiaa, auhswr,2019-02-25 20:12:57, 2019, 2,25, Your trip is tomorrow but you haven't booked your flight? ,RickyLidz\lneh9oagb, eh8aiaa, auhswr,2019-02-25 20:13:47, 2019, 2,25, Yeah, I wasn’t sure I would be able to get time off from work until yesterday.  ,HenryBalzac\lnehaig7o, ehahj20, auhswr,2019-02-26 02:15:34, 2019, 2,26, > Apparently you can also USE you expired passport for that extra year to travel internationally (that’s what she told me, anyway).
