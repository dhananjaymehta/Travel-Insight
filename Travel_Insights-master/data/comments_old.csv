eh75zv5, au7mi9, 2019-02-24 20:56:32,2019, 2, 24,My only problem with it is it fills the road with nervous drivers who drive extra slow around the country lanes because they are narrow. For us locals its extremaly frustrating

However it is an extremely beautiful place
If your going here, here are a few places that some locals ( me and my family ) recommend;
Lulworth cove
Old harry rocks
Fossil forest
Scratch bottom (yes, that is a place)
Chesil beach
Portland
Weymouth beach
Kimeridge
Maiden castle
Bulbarrow hill
Hambledon hill
Hodd hill

Not you though. I didn‚Äôt pay enough attention to usernames in the thread. My apologies. I confused you with that guy.

I‚Äôm American too. Driving on the other side of the road is way less challenging and dramatic than people think. Thankfully in the UK the steering wheel is on the right. It‚Äôs way more intuitive. They also use miles and not km on their roads which should help. The worst is places in the Caribbean like the USVI, BVI, and The Bahamas (not technically Caribbean, I know) where they use American vehicles with the steering wheel on the left but they also drive on the left. The visibility is so bad and it just doesn‚Äôt feel right., realjd

The easy way to get here is to fly into Myanmar through Yangon or Mandalay, and then connect to Heho airport. From there it's just a 35 kilometer bus ride to Nyaungshwe on the northern side of the lake. Then you either travel on the lake on a day trip, or you can catch a boat to other parts of the lake. The other parts are way less developed than Nyaungshwe.

Highly recommended, and pay your boat driver well!, uspn

Places like Inle Lake, Kalaw, Pindaya, Pyin Oo Lwin (tourist destinations) are for the most part calm and stable and have been spared from the ongoing conflict. There is very high security across the region and its practically impossible to reach the conflict zones as a foreigner. , globe_trekker

Best thing to do:  Toronto islands are great but might be terrible in March, graffiti alley for pictures, Toronto is a great walking around city with high park, UofT area etc but will depends on weather.  

, Bouje13 
eh76ht1, auc3za, 2019-02-24 21:02:17,2019, 2, 24,Go to Parkdale neighbourhood, walk up or down roncesvalles st for shops and food etc, then go to High park for a nice stroll.  There's a little free zoo in the park that's fun.  Lots of good coffee/food/drinks around there, Parkdale is probably the coolest neighbourhood right now as far as being gentrified enough to have nice stuff but not so gentrified that it's just shitty condos and nothing else...

&#x200B;

Because Toronto is the biggest city in canada all of it's museums and galleries are the best ones in Canada (for the most part) so if you need a chill afternoon or there's shit weather you can go to the art gallery or the Royal Ontario Museum and you won't be disappointed.

&#x200B;

Steer away from downtown unless you want to do some shopping on a good exchange rate, the main businessy downtown is pretty blah, being basically Canada's wall street district and all that sort of boring shit., _m_s_l_ 
eh7d5n8, auc3za, 2019-02-24 22:19:42,2019, 2, 24,I would definitely advise staying away from the downtown core unless you're absolutely set on seeing the main attractions (aquarium, CN tower, Hockey Hall of Fame, etc.). TBH Toronto's downtown is pretty bleak, especially in the winter. Kensington is a great location to base yourself, and it's full of good restaurants. I especially love Nu Bugel and Cafe Pamenar. There's also a great pizza place nearby (out of the market) called Fresca Pizza. 

&#x200B;

I think someone already mentioned the ROM and AGO - both are great, but if you only have time/energy for one, I'd choose the ROM. It's free on Tuesdays for students with valid ID, if that applies to you. The AGO is free for everyone on Wednesday evenings (but expect long lines). I also saw someone else recommended High Park and its zoo - definitely recommend this if the weather cooperates. High Park is one of my favourite places in the city.

&#x200B;

Kensington is adjacent to China Town, which is fun to walk around in for a while. Mother's Dumplings is an amazing dumpling restaurant in the neighbourhood. If you make your way to the Queen West neighbourhood there's some good shopping, and some cool vintage shops (The Black Market is a particularly wacky one).

eh6uqbc, auam65, 2019-02-24 18:47:05,2019, 2, 24,I assume they started out as stickers hotels/airlines used to identify where bags were being taken, and then people started making similar ones for fun/vanity.

I just took a stab in the dark and googled bag stickers titanic, [and it looks like they did have ones for specific fare classes](https://store.titanichistoricalsociety.org/product/25-white-star-line-luggage-labels-and-stickers/).

[And this site claims that as people came off ships](https://laughingelephant.com/why-were-luggage-labels-created/), the luggage would be sorted to the proper hotels and they'd then use their stickers to confirm which hotel the luggage was headed.

Also not sure if this book would provide more insights, [WORLD TOUR: Vintage Hotel Labels From the Collection of Gaston-Louis Vuitton](https://www.amazon.com/World-Tour-Vintage-Collection-Gaston-Louis/dp/1419706829).

[This article says](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/history-humble-suitcase-180951376/):
> Suitcases began as an afterthought in the luggage and leather goods business, but they soon became the very symbol of travel.

So it stands to reason why people would want to advertise where they've been, it was a status symbol when travel was starting to become popular with the masses.

[And this article states](http://www.ephemerasociety.org/examples/ex-luggagetags.html):
> The golden era of hotel luggage labels ranged from about 1875 to the 1950s. Hotels designed and printed them to promote their establishments. Travelers gathered and pasted them as honor badges of their wide-ranging experience. As labels grew in favor, hotels tried to outdo each other with ever-larger labels and elaborate designs. Labels started to disappear as soft sided luggage came into favor and chains replaced individually owned and managed venues.

> Hotel luggage labels make for interesting history. For example, consider the composite image of various Bristol Hotel labels. As Victorian-era travelers grew more discerning, individual venues needed to convey a quality image to promote themselves. The many worldwide Bristol hotels of the golden age of travel were unaffiliated as the different independent establishment assumed the name Bristol to attract new customers.

I really don't know any info on the subject, your question was just interesting enough to google.

So it seems like it was a cross between the advent of mass steamership travel, lots of luggage needing labels for ships/hotels, and people wanting to show off where they've been during a timeperiod that was just starting to have mass long-distance travel for leisure purposes., jadeoracle

I really loved it. It was just stunning and a really relaxing place to be. I've uploaded some of the [photos](https://imgur.com/a/utMUqqA) I took but honestly they don't do it justice. Lots of tourists though so if that's something that bothers you maybe it wouldn't be for you.

I've been to Geneva (separate occasion, spent 4 days there) and I'm not honestly sure what you'd do with one day in Geneva. It's much larger than Ann√©cy and I felt like it was a city that benefited more from wandering around for a few days in different areas. Add in the fact you'll have to change currency and the huge price of eating there and I probably wouldn't bother doing it as a day trip.

Some of the southern French cities (e.g. Marseille) are accessible by TGV in short enough times to make them day trippable, so you may want to consider those as well., travellingtw

An entire region of the world speaks Spanish and it's also a common 2nd language in many places.

Any non-European language is going to be more challenging and the languages more closely related to English like German or Dutch are not going to necessarily be any easier in terms of masculine/feminine nouns and grammar, etc. Plus there's little point in speaking these languages as most Germanic language group peoples will speak at least passable English., Oax_Mike 
eh6rp99, auagug, 2019-02-24 18:10:50,2019, 2, 24,I would recommend Spanish or French.  As some others have said, a whole continent speaks Spanish, and then countries like Switzerland, Montenegro, and Morocco, etc. all have French as national language, as well.    Plus, once you learn one Romance language, the rest are easy peasy since they're so similar.    Honestly, the masculine/feminine part isn't a huge issue and most people will be able to grasp your meaning even if you use the wrong one.  I speak French, so I'm not sure if such a thing exists for Spanish, but there's a verb conjugation guide called the Bescherelle that is a list of every single french verb and their conjugations for different tenses and that might come in handy for you.  , illusoir3

And it all depends, where would you like to travel? 

Everybody here I have read so far has said Spanish but nobody has asked and you haven't specified where you would like to go (as far as I can tell). 

Spanish is good because it's easy for an English speaker to learn, and most Portuguese/Brazilian people can understand you in Spanish. It's also spoken across central and south America 

French and English are spoken *fairly* widely across countries in Africa. French and English are spoken in Canada (obviously). English is understood in the big French cities but most French people can still pick up basic English words. Also, there's some area(s?) of south/central America and Vietnam where French is spoken, but I haven't looked too deeply into this. 

The big warning I'll give about learning Spanish as people here are saying a native English speaker should is that both languages have many extremely different variations of this language. At least with English, the Australians, Brits and Americans can understand each other but a Jamaican might have problems speaking to us. The same issue applies with the variations of French and Spanish but across most countries. I learned this when I met a group of Mexicans struggling to understand a Colombian guy, then someone from Barcelona came along and had the same problem as the Colombian guy. They could all still communicate but it was very much like "What?" or they were repeating themselves. Sometimes they found it easier to speak in English to each other., Kroonay 
eh76avl, auagug, 2019-02-24 21:00:04,2019, 2, 24,Spanish since almost all of south America speaks it. Or French for a nice variety of  places as well.

But coming from English I would say that of the big languages there isn't really one that is so similar that you have a head start.  
So, the best for you to learn is whatever is used around you in your circle of friends or amongst your coworkers the most.

Spanish is generally considered among  the easiest to learn and covers big chunks  of the world.  Genders can take some getting used to, but they're quite common, and languages that don't have them will likely have other features you'll find even more daunting. 

I've learned a couple of languages, and the reality is that it will take consistent work. I'm not sure where you are/ what the situation is that makes classes impossible, but I've found that they're *enormously* helpful for getting started.

I travel a lot in Eastern Europe, and have also visited the Caucasus and am headed to Central Asia shortly, and Russian is widely understood (if not widely loved). Having that awareness of the Cyrillic alphabet also helps you read quite a few other related languages.  However, I use Spanish more often, as it's easy for me to pop down into Mexico and Central America, but I would say that for me, it's almost less useful than Russian because most of the places where I do speak Spanish, I could probably switch over to English and still get by just fine.  , FearlessTravels 
eh6s2ru, auagug, 2019-02-24 18:15:18,2019, 2, 24,I‚Äôd argue French over Spanish as more regions of the world have French spoken somewhere but both are excellent choices. I‚Äôm definitely not fluent in French but I know the language fairly well.

And truthfully, I thought that male/female differences were also a pain but they are MUCH easier compared to some of the Eastern European languages. I‚Äôm trying to learn Croatian right now and it‚Äôs wicked hard, and my family is half Croatian, so while none of us living now know the language, many of the sounds come fairly natural. I also studied abroad for a semester in Budapest and took Hungarian which is an absolute beast. 

Another edit: it‚Äôs not a problem if you think you don‚Äôt sound good when trying to speak in a foreign language! There‚Äôs a reason why it‚Äôs foreign and that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre unfamiliar with it so it‚Äôs awkward to use. It‚Äôs always better to try and talk through something and to butcher your pronunciations than not try at all! Besides - almost everyone I have ever met abroad is happy when you try to speak in the local language. Keep it up and don‚Äôt be afraid!

Pro tip as well: a little alcohol can help because it calms your nerves and you don‚Äôt overthink your pronunciations as much!, blissfully_chilling 
eh6upee, auagug, 2019-02-24 18:46:48,2019, 2, 24,The whole gender thing in Spanish can be difficult but totally worth it. 20+ nations have Spanish as a national language. Portuguese is similar enough that you could probably get by or learn the basics with ease once you've learned Spanish. There are even some words in Arabic that are similar to Spanish.   


It's really hard to learn a different language. My best advice would be take a class or get a really good book for the basics. Once you understand the basics it's easier to do somethings on your own. I learned the basics of Spanish in Ecuador and have been doing the rest on my own since. You're going to sound like a toddler when you speak. I still do even though my reading, understanding, and writing has improved greatly. Practice as much as you can. , IHateFrank1

eh7rgbt, auagug, 2019-02-25 01:33:59,2019, 2, 25,Hmmm, Brazilians cannot understand Spanish as they speak fast and have a lot of accent? The opposite also doesn't happen. A lot of things to factor in such as accent, speed of speech and how words are spoken. I speak both languages and Portuguese has SO many words that are used in different contexts depending what you are talking about, and the slang list is mad long. Not to mention how some words do exist in both languages but they mean completely different things.

If you go to Brazil and assume they can understand you cause you speak Spanish so same, they will see that as somewhat as an insult as this is a very common mistake cause you know, they speak Portuguese lmao. Also, Brazilians tend to try to speak Spanish in a very unhelpful way by adding -ito to everything so it "sounds more like Spanish". 

Yet, whenever I try to show things in Portuguese to my Spanish speaker friends, they don't understand what they say.

You can go to Brazil with English, if you go to the big centers, you will most likely find some random dude that can at least tell you a thing or two. You have better chances with English than Spanish to be honest lmao. 

Unless you are in the mood to speak very slowly so they can hear every single part of the word you are saying. I went to Argentina knowing English and Portuguese, and my teacher told me she would teach me using Portuguese instead. But whenever I'd talk to my host in Portuguese, I had to do it very slowly because she wouldn't understand.

I recommend watching TV shows in the language you learn, read passages, go over to r/languagelearning and see what they got for you there. That's their field. In this subreddit, we deal with everything related to seeing the places, where to go and what to do (or not to do) in particular places. This question works here but the above subreddit has the more specific advice and materials for you., Kroonay

eh6agae, au84nj, 2019-02-24 14:26:28,2019, 2, 24,This is a weird proposal because Athens isn't a place you go for a week.

eh6n3i1, au84nj, 2019-02-24 17:14:17,2019, 2, 24,I grew up in Athens, and semi-regularly returned as an adult.  
Athens is the type of city that blooms when you experience it with a local. Athens' charm is its lust for life. Going out and partying in Kolonaki, Exarcheia, and especially in its suburbs Vouliagmeni/Voula/Glyfada and Kifisia.  
If you go there as a tourist, chances are you will feel filled after 2 days, and after you checked off the 3-4 main tourist sites. Most of which are in or near the pretty grungy neighborhoods in the downtown area. And that grungy point is very polarizing in itself - some people find it charming, others consider it a major turn off.  
And for people on vacation for longer than a long weekend, the real charm of Greece are of course the islands and the countryside.  
  
Tokyo is the greatest city in the world, if you ask me (not the best or most exciting, that goes to Berlin). But it's an orange in direct comparison with the apple that is Athens. It's so different, an entirely different league. Tokyo is structured and organized, and high-gloss. Athens is grungy, chaotic and disorganized. Both are full of life at night.

That train also passes through Herculaneum (Ercolano) on it's way to Pompeii.

There are tour operators in Napoli who run shuttle buses between Napoli, Herculaneum and Pompeii, but they are overpriced, not running very often and they stuck in Napoli's traffic jams., johnnyguinness

I have been to both because I have slept about 10 nights in Napoli in the last 3.5 years across 2 different trips to Italy. The recommendations I make are off an assumption this may just be the only trip you make to Southern Italy in the next few years.

A lot of good stuff was moved from both sites to the aforementioned museum in Napoli. Therefore:

If you have only one day - the museum and Herculaneum can be done in one day.
2 days - Pompeii is big enough that I don't think you can expect to do a lot else on the same day. This would be less true if you were using Sorrento as a base. Do the museum + something else in Napoli on the second day., terminal_e

In Italy I had a much more enjoyable experience walking through the ruins at [Ostia Antica](https://goo.gl/maps/wkYizazfGKJ2) near Rome. That was quiet, big, overgrown and I had free roam.

Castel Sant'Elmo is incredible. I walked up the hill to get there which was 40¬∞C and in the summer, I had little water when going up it. Bought water at the top for an extortionate price. Got down the hill, bought lemonade and not bottled water. Learned my lesson the hard way that if I'm abroad, I must learn the word for water in the local language. 

Still, the castle offers a beautiful view of the city. A bus can take you straight to it. It's 2-3‚Ç¨ entry too (can't quite remember?). Highly recommend. 

Keep in mind, the crime rate in Naples is quite bad and policing is notoriously corrupt there, so if a tourist was to file a report for pickpocketing, your case would be one of thousands in a week but your own world will come crashing down on you. I've seen this happen but not had it happen to me because I keep my head down and watch where I step (and because I'm over 6-feet tall and male probably). Don't let this put you off though but across much of the South of Italy, they're not as wealthy as those up north. Still one of my most favourite cities I have been to. , Kroonay

Unless you make the first ferry out, I don't know if Ischia/Procida/Capri as day trip options really make sense. Haven't been to Procida.

If you want to get to Bruges earlier, another option, if you can find a way to Manchester Airport, is a 10:05 flight from Manchester to Brussels landing at 12:25 (15 minutes after your train from Chesterfield would arrive in London), and then a 12:58 train to Bruges arriving at 14:30, 3 hours earlier., Creek0512

Might as well scrap Bruges and just fly to Prague. It‚Äôs 7 hours to Bruges and you‚Äôre leaving on the 15@4th. You‚Äôll barely have 1/2 a day.

As for Vienna you‚Äôre not giving Budapest enough time or Vienna. Move that day to Budapest... especially since you were intending on taking the train there in the evening on 7:19 so you‚Äôd only have 1 full day. You need at minimum 2 full days in Budapest, ideally 3.

No need for Eurail. Prague->Budapest is a cheap train ticket purchased in advanced. It may even be cheaper buying a same day ticket than using a Eurail. Make sure you get seat reservations, can get crowded on that route during summer., swollencornholio

1. I would not get EuRail pass. You can do that a lot cheaper by just getting the individual trains/busses.

2. 1 day in Vienna is not enough imo.

3. On your question about staying in party hostels in Budapest and/or Prague. My opinion, just go for it. I've stayed in party hostels before (not Budapest level, yet) and they are some of the most fun I ever have. Budapest party hostels and the nightlife there is world renowned. Just for it.

eh7q8te, auby70, 2019-02-25 01:16:30,2019, 2, 25,Ya, I was restricted by school obligations or I would've stayed longer if I could have. I'm leaving the day after my semester ends and I'm getting home the day before a summer program for my university starts. 

It's 13 cities, starting in Prague and ending in Istanbul. Excluding flights in/out of Europe, I'm looking to spend around $3500. I could do it with $3000, but that'd be too shoestring for me. The biggest variation of my spending during trips is and always has been alcohol consumption. I'm a pretty heavy partier on trips, so I know to take that into consideration when budgeting. Everything else is budgeted to a tee though so let me know if you have any questions., rohansfinest 
eh7ifou, auby70, 2019-02-24 23:25:00,2019, 2, 24,Alright, I appreciate your perspective.

During my past two trips, I've heard so many fellow travelers (like 15+) just talk about how crazy the budapest party hostels get and I just wanted to see for myself. I've got 5 nights booked at Retox Party Hostel for early June and I'm beyond stoked. I get it's definitely not the cleanest and it does look a little intimidating, but it just looks too fucking rowdy and wild to pass up. The worse that happens is I spend a night or two and pack my shit up and find another hostel., rohansfinest

The tunnels are really expensive (about 55 EUR one-way) so if the car and driver are up for it you might want to drive over one of the passes.

Where in France/Italy do you need to be? Getting from Marseille to Turin will be different from going from Chamonix to Como. , CheeseWheels38 
eh6s6zl, auaewu, 2019-02-24 18:16:43,2019, 2, 24,I've had a few 1-day LA/Anaheim trips, so you could:

* Do a day at Disneyland, get the MaxPass so you can get fastpasses on your phone. You won't be able to do everything, but you'll be able to hit the highlights.
* Do a day at Universal Studios, you'll likely be able to do pretty much everything
* Drive the Pacific Highway near Malibu (haven't done this since the fires though...)
* Santa Monica Pier, or the 3rd street avenue shopping area in Santa Monica
* Hit up some beaches (still have not done this, I get too distracted by other things)

One time I did a museum only weekend: 

* Vist the Getty Museum, its free
* Get timed entry tickets to the Getty Villa (free but must get tickets in advance)
* La Brea Tar Pits
* California Science Center
* Natural History Museum
* The Broad
* Huntington Library, Art Gallery, and Botanical Gardens
* Norton Simon Museum

There are also quirky places I've heard of but not been to yet:

* Time Travel Mart 
* Museum of Jurassic Technology, jadeoracle

From there drive over the mountain, check out the Hollywood sign. Do the stars walk if that interests you, then drive down sunset Blvd to Santa Monica. Walk the pier and walk to and through Venice, maybe chill at the beach if there‚Äôs any time left. That‚Äôll be a good way to spend a day., swollencornholio 
eh6rji2, auaewu, 2019-02-24 18:08:55,2019, 2, 24,Do Santa Monica , Venice Beach,Abbott Kinney all next too each other. Pasadena , Glendale,;: museums etc old town.
Silverman /echo park, hipsterville area., redrosesparis11 
eh6y7py, auaewu, 2019-02-24 19:28:09,2019, 2, 24,LA is amazing but distances and traffic can make it difficult to do a lot of different things if in different parts of town.  


If you like history you have both the Reagan and Nixon Presidential museums (although they are not that close to each other).  
Museum of Contemporary Art in LA is cool even just on the outside (go at dusk to see the lamp post exhibit)  
Santa Monica and Venice Beach have both the beaches and surrounding areas which are nice to just be around but of course filled with tourists.  
Going south to Orange County and places like San Clemente or north to Malibu can always be fun.  
Downtown LA has become so cool and of course there is Beverly Hills and the Hollywood area plus places like Korea Town.

Endless theme parks from Disneyland, Universal Studio, WB Studios, Knotsberry Farm, etc.  
Plus endless food options of all types everywhere.  


And way more....

Ultimately it depends what you enjoy in a break, what the weather is, whether you are alone or with someone, your transportation options and comfortability navigating, how slow or fast you want to take it, etc.  


Enjoy!

eh7cyl5, auaewu, 2019-02-24 22:17:21,2019, 2, 24,Okay so that‚Äôs kind of outta town. I would take a place up there for the day of the conference but then take a place in LA for the following night. 

There‚Äôs a lot to do here! I would recommend not biting off too much in one day. If you want to do the beach you could stay in Santa Monica or Venice. If you want more of the city you can stay in DTLA or echo park silver lake. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend trying to go from the east side to the west side on a Saturday as traffic can be really bad. But done in small pieces LA is super fun and easy! You can even rent a place in topanga and get your hippie vibe on if you want. 

Depending on where you stay it might be cheaper to Uber/Lyft once In the city. Our public transport kind of sucks. But there is actually a train from downtown to the beach at Venice. We currently have a ton of art and great restaurants and cool bars. 

I really like to hike up the Griffith Observatory it‚Äôs a great way to see the city from a high point. 

If you have any questions when looking for places to stay feel free to ask me. LA can be big and crazy but with a little guidance it can be really fun! , steve8675 
eh7dhhs, auaewu, 2019-02-24 22:23:35,2019, 2, 24,Griffith Park as well. could do hikes or just check out the Observatory, hopefully its not too hazy depending on when his trip is, looks awesome.

eh7j6ty, aue2or, 2019-02-24 23:35:29,2019, 2, 24,I can't speak for Cabo but where I live in Mexico, every single intersection with a light will have an arrow. There are no solid green lights where you're just trusted to turn when it's safe. That said, most intersections won't have a light.

The rules for turning on a red are the same as the US but as a foreigner in a rented car in a super touristy area, I would just wait for the green light and not risk getting a ticket/fine.

Also...be careful about the left turn signal thing...yes, it often means pass but it also means turning left, which are two contradictory messages that can end with you being dead - especially since it's often buses and big trucks that use this retarded & dangerous system.

For yielding, forget about the rules and just yield to everyone in a rental car. Wait until there are large gaps and play it safe, especially since Mexicans are often speeding which makes it tough to judge how far away they need to be before it's safe to turn across traffic., Oax_Mike 
eh7dr55, aud45i, 2019-02-24 22:26:44,2019, 2, 24,I've been to HK and Japan (including both Disneys), but not Korea.

You definitely don't want to go in summer. June - September will be very hot and humid. I was in HK in June and it was difficult to do much because it was so humid. Early March in Japan was very nice. Warm enough that I didn't need a big coat but not so hot that walking was unpleasant. Later in March/early April gets expensive/busy because of the cherry blossoms. I imagine late April would be nice, but avoid Golden Week (late April/early May). Autumn in Japan is also supposed to be quite lovely.

Keep in mind that Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea have to be done on separate days because of how the tickets work, so with your current schedule you'll only have 1 day for Tokyo itself (and less than that if you're flying the same day). If you've never been to Tokyo before I'd maybe cut some of the Kyoto/Osaka/Hiroshima days and spend them in Tokyo because it would be a shame to spend the majority of your time in Tokyo at Disney. (Not that Disney is bad, just that Tokyo deserves to be seen).

HK Disney is pretty small and when we went midweek we only stayed till about 2pm, so you may be able to fit in other stuff on that day.

It does sound like you'll be doing A LOT of travelling around on trains and stuff, so I would probably cut out a couple of places or all you'll be seeing is the inside of train stations. It's also worth noting that while train travel in Japan is pleasant and efficient it is also pretty pricey., travellingtw

eh7fqhy, aud45i, 2019-02-24 22:50:14,2019, 2, 24,Personally I think it‚Äôs too much. I‚Äôd want 3 nights in Hong Kong before considering factoring in Disney. And Kyoto needs at least 2 full days as a lot of the main sights are far out from the city. Osaka could be one full day at a push. 

We did 3 nights Tokyo, 3 nights Kyoto and 1 night Osaka and it worked really well - but again, didn‚Äôt do any Disney stuff so maybe you‚Äôd need to allow a bit more time in Tokyo too, louiseoxford 
eh7yzu2, aud45i, 2019-02-25 03:20:11,2019, 2, 25,I honestly think it's too much.

Another thing is that while Daegu is a big/major city, I doesnt seem to have the culture and food of some of the other cities.

I would do 3 days in Seoul, 1 day in Gyeongju and 3 days in Busan with the days you have.

If I were you, I would cut out Hong Kong and just do a week in Korea and a week in Japan! It would give you another reason to go back and see HK and other Chinese cities!

I hope it's a great trip!!, d12green 
eh7q7ys, aud45i, 2019-02-25 01:16:09,2019, 2, 25,I agree with cutting out Kyoto - I very much like it, but I also very much think you need 4 days there. Haven't spent any real time in Osaka, haven't made it to Hiroshima.  

I echo the thoughts on weather - May and October are great. I have been to Tokyo in April (greyish) and December (a subtly very cool time to be in Japan. The summer time scares me. I had a brutally cold weekend in Seoul in December a couple years back. The only additional gotcha is that Kyoto has a very busy fall foliage season allegedly - make sure you understand when that is before booking say a last minute flight., terminal_e 
eh7g8ax, aud45i, 2019-02-24 22:56:01,2019, 2, 24,Thanks, both of you suggest the schedule would be too much.  I know this is subjective, but with the idea that about a week in Korea would be non-negotiable, what would you cut out?  Cut out HK altogether, or cut out destinations in Japan?  Or both?

For some reason I've always wanted to visit the Atomic Bomb memorial/dome in Hiroshima, but Kyoto/Osaka might not be a must-see for me.  So I could just do Hiroshima then straight to Tokyo?, Adult_Noob 
eh7za4l, aud45i, 2019-02-25 03:24:16,2019, 2, 25,Thanks, the Daegu part is cause of family/relatives, so I want to spend time with them.  But otherwise yea, I'm leaning towards cutting out HK on this trip., Adult_Noob 
eh7i9ys, aud45i, 2019-02-24 23:22:47,2019, 2, 24,It depends what you like more really! 

If you‚Äôre really into the idea of Asian cities then I‚Äôd go Hong Kong. There‚Äôs lots to see and it‚Äôs not too touristy. I really loved it there. 

But if you want a bit more variety and something less city-like then I‚Äôd probably keep in Kyoto instead. While it‚Äôs touristy, you can find peace in a beautiful tea garden... after battling selfie sticks in the bamboo forest and Unari gates!

Travel is also a consideration as flying to and from Hong Kong is a lot more time consuming and tiring (with the whole airport business) than getting the bullet train around Japan. 

Finally, Hong Kong is a good one to save for another time as it twins well with so many places (Macau, Thailand, Australia for starters). 

It‚Äôs a hard one - if I was to just pick between the two I‚Äôd go Hong Kong but with all the other considerations I‚Äôd stay in Japan for your trip!, louiseoxford 
eh7lanp, aud45i, 2019-02-25 00:04:55,2019, 2, 25,Thanks, this is very helpful.  I think your point about the travel logistics of HK is salient. Obviously being a separate country, having to fly in and out just for 1 city/short trip, etc might be a bit much. 

Japan and Korea seem much easier logistically to twin on a trip, and I could easily do 1 week in each., Adult_Noob

My group stopped a few times, one of the stops being Murray Family Farms (The Big Red Barn). It's pretty unique, you can get fresh fruits and other snacks.

eh82lwd, aug7hj, 2019-02-25 04:13:15,2019, 2, 25,Maybe South America somewhere. Kids that age won‚Äôt benefit much from a bunch of museums they‚Äôll be bored of in Europe. My parents always refused to take me to Europe until I was older as they saw this. I spent a lot of time in Mexico and went to Nicaragua instead, which looking back on I appreciate because you get to see how you are lucky in comparison to the rest of the world. Obviously nothing too rough, but enough to get the point across. I would save a larger trip here until the younger is 7-8. 

I‚Äôd say that Japan is a safe choice. They won‚Äôt be bored at all (Tokyo would‚Äôve been paradise for younger me) and it‚Äôll introduce them to an entirely different culture, but I don‚Äôt think it would do much to teach.

How about a little help from you first? The Wester U.S. is a pretty big place. Are there place here you‚Äôd like to show them? New England, centering in Boston, is certainly cultural, has ton ‚Äî and I mean tons ‚Äî of things to do. Mid-Atlantic state, including Washington, same thing.

Are you committed to international travel? Then I‚Äôd wonder if your family‚Äôs heritage/ethnicity would be a good touchstone. If that‚Äôs something you‚Äôd like your kids to learn about, the answer would point you to certain countries, right?

Are your kids into athletics? Art? Trains? Kids like trains. Kids interested in what mom or dad does for a living?

I am wondering if Spain in April would work:  
La Liga is still on - take them to a soccer game.  
Barcelona has Gaudi and Montaner architecture, which will probably intrigue kids.  
Barcelona has a pretty good aquarium.  
High speed rail - I am guessing the kids may have never been on a train, much less anything > 100mph
Perhaps add Cordoba and Granada as well- they might think the Alhambra is a movie set

If you go in the summer, the beach would be an option.

eh7v6sp, auf7yz, 2019-02-25 02:26:33,2019, 2, 25,Lots of people fly into Leon who are planning on visiting San Miguel (SMA). Lots of transpo options to SMA. Plenty of buses between SMA and CDMX (Mexico City) as well. That one is a bit of a longer haul but not too bad., 1dad1kid 
eh7yabi, auf7yz, 2019-02-25 03:10:01,2019, 2, 25,You can definitely bus between Guanajuato and Allende. (Not sure about Hidalgo, but my guess is yes.)

Be careful around Leon -- it can be dodgy in areas. I wouldn't recommend driving in Mexico City, also, unless you already know you're up for it. Sounds like you've made a similar mistake before? ;), ExternalUserError

eh7mmec, auekvh, 2019-02-25 00:24:01,2019, 2, 25,Go to the hospital and take care of that foot! 
Also, things worth doing aren‚Äôt always easy. You‚Äôre in a new setting and out of your comfort zone, it‚Äôll take some time getting used to but you got this. , georgiahippie 
eh7o86k, auekvh, 2019-02-25 00:47:19,2019, 2, 25,Travel is stressful: new and unfamiliar places, possibly a language barrier, different societal and cultural norms, logistics of living, planning tourist attractions, etc. Some people find it incredibly rewarding, but some people simply find it stressful. Some people just want to go lay on a beach, sip cocktails, and get massages when they're on vacation, and that's totally fine.

Also, take care of your foot. If you hurt your foot and got it infected at home, would you still be trying to go about your day? Would you be going to work and walking around your city with a fever and chills? Don't be stupid and go to the hospital.

Finally, it's also okay to realize something isn't actually your dream. By all means try again if you want to, but if you decide that traveling isn't for you, you should still feel good about the fact that you pursued your dream and found it wasn't for you. It's better than the multitudes of people who just dream their dreams and never pursue them., NYCheesecakes 
eh7msqb, auekvh, 2019-02-25 00:26:33,2019, 2, 25,Two things:

1. For some people Travel isn't fun or the answer. Its fine if you find out you are one of them. The other thing to consider is sometimes you have to take babysteps. Is this your first ever trip alone? For me I did trips to English speaking countries first with family, then touristy areas with groups, and then my own trips by myself. One of the most culture shock places I went to was Egypt. If I had done that as my first trip...I probably would have freaked out and not like travel. So some people have to start small. Or maybe you just need to push on through. So if you do go home, maybe try going someplace that is easier or for a shorter time period to dip your feet back in the water slowly.

2. FUCK. That sucks when you are injured and sick on your own. If its infected and you have a high fever it definitely is time to see a doctor. Follow their advice, and if you have to come home do it. But know that this setback doesn't necessarily mean you aren't fit for Travel. My last major trip was Costa Rica/Panama, and I got swimmer's ear, a major cold, and pink eye all at the same time. I felt like shit and once the fever set in and my eyes swelled shut I seriously considered getting medivac from the country. I was just so sick, and didn't speak the language. Luckily I was on a group trip, so our group leader helped translate and got me meds, and made me his mother's home remedy for the cold. I was still sick, but enough for me to continue my trip. But man, that still does down as one of the worst trips ever for me.  Thankfully I've traveled enough to know that was a rare/weird situation. So I will want to travel again (even back to Panama) in the future., jadeoracle 
eh7qk5z, auekvh, 2019-02-25 01:21:09,2019, 2, 25,Hang in there. Get medical attention. Take it one day at a time. Don't be hard on yourself. This set back will make you stronger once you're out the other side., gltgl 
eh7x5w9, auekvh, 2019-02-25 02:54:20,2019, 2, 25,Get medical attention and stay for one month. If the travel thing still isn't turning you on then go home at that time.

Travel isn't for everyone. There's no shame in pulling in the plug after you've given it an honest try.

Good luck no matter what you decide., Kananaskis_Country

eh7g95h, audcoz, 2019-02-24 22:56:17,2019, 2, 24,Ah ok I think I see the difference. 

On Omio you put 3 children (meaning age 0-11) while on Eurostar you put 3 youths (meaning age 12-25).

If you put them as children on Eurostar too (assuming theyre 11 or younger) it shows the same price as on Omio. The difference is Omio only has child (0-11) and adult (12+) tickets while Eurostar has child (0-11), youth (12-25), and adult (26+)., panameboss 
eh7gnpm, audcoz, 2019-02-24 23:01:22,2019, 2, 24,Aha!   Omio does not have the same definition for youths... anyone over 14 is an adult!

eh7g1ne, aucfe8, 2019-02-24 22:53:49,2019, 2, 24,If you want a beach then Gili T is great. Mainland Bali beaches were disappointing to me, but if I was to return I‚Äôd try out the Jimbaran area which looks better than Seminyak, Kira, Canggu areas. 

Nusa Penida is an Island I‚Äôd love to visit, although it‚Äôs worth noting that it‚Äôs very steep and so has rough seas - many beaches you can‚Äôt swim in the sea. 

If you pick Gili T I recommend staying further from the dock, towards the north. It‚Äôs so beautiful and peaceful, even in peak season , louiseoxford 
eh7bhcm, aucfe8, 2019-02-24 21:59:57,2019, 2, 24,Lombok is beautiful with quite a lot to do. Gili islands are well known and documented - very beautiful.

Sumbawa is the most remote and would probably yield some incredibly special places if you know where to look. , 2RightsMake1Wrong

Wear whatever you would wear in those temperatures.

Depending on what electronics you are bringing you may need a converter. You‚Äôll at minimum likely need an adaptor, swollencornholio 
eh70ple, aua4t1, 2019-02-24 19:56:47,2019, 2, 24,November in those cities will probably not be super cold, but it will probably be pretty wet. Bring a raincoat (preferably one that breathes) and maybe waterproof shoes (although I've never done that... but being in a very snowy place right now, my waterproof boots are the best thing ever). 

If you're just bringing a phone and/or computer, you'll just need the adapter... search Amazon for the right one for Italy (that of course, being Italy, is different from the rest of Europe... or at least it can be). If you are planning to bring something like a hairdryer or flatiron or something else like that... rethink your plan because you either need a dual voltage thing or you risk ruining the appliance or the power. You can always buy something there, but most hotels and airbnb's I've stayed in have had hairdryers.

eh5pf1j, au53zt, 2019-02-24 06:40:04,2019, 2, 24,your itinerary so far honestly looks amazing!! to answer one of your questions, the quickest way to get from the airport to seoul is the train. the airport railroad express will take you right into stations that are in seoul, and from there you can transfer to whichever subway line you need to take to get to where you're staying. i would also 100% do n seoul tower over lotte tower. 

unfortunately i can't really answer any of your other questions, but for hongdae, definitely hang around the main street in the early night time. the street performers there are some of my most memorable experiences from my trips to korea. also would recommend trying lots of the restaurants in hongdae. almost all of them are really good!!

i hope you have an amazing trip!!!, elyhria 
eh5pfir, au53zt, 2019-02-24 06:40:19,2019, 2, 24,A bit late here. So will just give s ome advise from the top of my head. My trip however was Busan, jeju and Seoul.

N tower was not worth it AT all.
Bukchon Hanok Village was also not that interesting.

However, I did enjoy Nami Island, petite France and the garden of morning clam.

Guessing by this that maybe you aren't into that. Since you veto Nami Island from the get go.

I'd suggest to map this on Google maps and see how far are the areas from each other. I normally plan out my day activities like that if I have so much stuff I want to see/do. , yupyupyeh

eh7tvgx, aue321, 2019-02-25 02:08:05,2019, 2, 25,Baltimore's airport is small and you won't have any trouble navigating it. You'll go downstairs to collect your baggage and you will probably walk right outside of the baggage claim doors to catch your ride. It's very simple; don't stress. 

As for the city, be aware of your surroundings. Shows like The Wire and Homicide haven't done the city any favors. But there's great stuff to see and visit- the Walters Art Museum and the Baltimore Museum of Art have excellent collections and are free. Fort McHenry is worth a stop. Eat a crab cake and some oysters. Visit Fells Point and Federal Hill. 

The director John Waters once said, "The people of New York think they're weird but they're really normal. The people from Baltimore think they're normal but they're really weird". We're proud of our weirdness. :) , ADCarter1

Especially with our fairly mild weather lately, the chances of there still being snow are slim. If you really want to do snow activities, I suggest going anytime between now and mid March. It could warm up fast by April and melt a lot of the snow. , Sunni-Bunni

eh7y9i3, aud25d, 2019-02-25 03:09:43,2019, 2, 25,It'll still be easy to find snow in mid-April. Even if the townsite itself is snow free you'll need very little elevation gain to get back into it.

April is shoulder season so you won't be facing the insane crowds that summer brings.

You give no clue where you're coming from. I assume you're driving in from Edmonton or Calgary? Make sure your rental has 4WD or AWD with snow tires and you'll be fine. Both the Trans Canada Highway and Icefield Parkway from Calgary and Highway 16 from Edmonton are well maintained. (If you have a choice of airports then fly into Calgary. The drive through Canmore, Banff, Lake Louise and up the Icefield Parkway is spectacular.)

This area is a *massively* popular tourist destination so it's super easy to research.

It is about a 15min taxi to the strip proper. 

Personally, not a big gambler, but when it is Vegas! I cannot attest to win rates at certain places (I go blackjack: very simple) but there is something about the Luxor that sucks the luck out of the world.  By way of anecdote from more hardened card sharks, those claim they have never had a good run there. 

On a completely different tact, there are always inedible shows at night, and if that doesn't work for your hours, the Bellagio apparently has an impressive collection of Renaissance art.

eh716az, aubslq, 2019-02-24 20:02:03,2019, 2, 24,Assuming your a US citizen, yes you can leave with no issue.

If your a gambler or just want to see the Vegas strip, it‚Äôs very close to the airport so you can certainly go there. Old Vegas is cool and not too far either. With a 8 hour layover you‚Äôll have a solid 5-6 hours to explore.

So options are:

-Gamble
-Walk the strip to take in the scenery
-check out old Vegas which has a zip line and is also fun for exploring etc
-Get a nice dinner in either area, tons of interesting/different spots
-Strip clubs if that‚Äôs your thing are better than most spots in the US

So, probably 80% of the time, you can go do your thing for 4-5 hours, but the other 20% of the time you might feel stressed out as you could lose an hour just waiting for luggage + a cab.    
  
McCarran Airport is fairly lame, and wouldn't be a fun place you spend 8 hours.

It's nearby, cheap, easy to get to, and besides the convenience it is a really lovely city that you could either do as a day trip or stay there overnight.

eh6z9te, au9klj, 2019-02-24 19:40:23,2019, 2, 24,Japan is amazing, but might be able to do it a little cheaper than 150 per night.  But if you prefer the standard that 150 per night gives you, then yes it will prove costly.  Guatemala will be much cheaper.

I found staying in apartments in Japan for a couple of nights better value as it meant you could cook for yourself and do washing giving you chance to travel light.

Have you checked out AirBNB type sights for prices?  You can then check out what transport is available to places on outskirts of major locations and get a travel ticket to mooch around before moving on to next area.

We stayed outside Tokyo centre not far from Tachikawa.  It has a monorail linking you to some lively little places like Tama Zoo which has an amazing orangutan skywalk above your head.

It wasn‚Äôt much trouble to get into central Tokyo to visit the government buildings, or shibuya for the famous crossing and statue of hachiko.  It wasn‚Äôt far for the studio ghibli museum or hello kitty museum (if you like pop culture stuff).  We even did two days climbing mt Fuji.

Remember that train travel in Japan is bloody spectacular!

But if you prefer a higher standard of accommodation and tourism, yep I think it will be costly (we like to do things as cheap as possible as long as places are clean), Princes_Slayer

eh74150, au9klj, 2019-02-24 20:34:18,2019, 2, 24,Thank you for your elaborate answer. Really appreciate it! 
It's not that we want some type of standard for $150, but just want something that is clean and spacious with everything working as it should. We're going to be outside of the apartment 90% of the time anyway, so it doesn't matter really if it's luxurious. As long as the location is good and it's clean. I guess it's also possible to get that for less than $100 a day if you know where to look? I found some Airbnb's for around $90 in the Kyoto/Osaka area. 
How many days each would you advice to stay in Tokyo and Kyoto? It seems like most people only spend 2-3 days in Tokyo and the rest in Kyoto to get around the rest of the country. How long did it take you to go from Tachikawa to the city center of Tokyo?

eh73qal, au9klj, 2019-02-24 20:30:52,2019, 2, 24,5K for two people? Or 5k each?

Either way, it sounds like the Central America trips would be better.

I've done both a Guatemala/Beliza/Mexico trip and a Costa Rica/Panama trip.

A Guatemala/Belize/Mexico would be good if you want culture. I started in Guatemala and saw the old colonial ruins of Antigua, then made my way to Florez and the Mayan ruins of Tikal. I then did the ATM caves in Belize, easily one of the coolest things I've done. (You get to see Mayan objects and sacrifices.) Then I headed to one of the islands for some beach/snorkeling time (although Caye Caulker doesn't have much of either, you have to take day trips by boat that ads extra costs.) And then we took a boat to Mexico and made our way up towards Cancun to see the Mayan ruins of Tulum and Chichen Itza and then some beach time in Cancun/Rivera Maya.

And I've done two trips to Costa Rica, one of which was a Costa Rica/Panama trip. I did a day in San Jose to hit up a tour of the National Theater, the Jade Museum, Gold Museum, History Museum, and did a walking tour with Barrio Birds, which was fun. Then I did white water rafting to Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, which is a fun backpackers beach town. I hung out by the beach but others went surfing or to the national parks nearby. (On a different trip I headed up to La Fortuna/La Arenal for the Volcano/Hot Springs/Cloud Forest.) Then we headed into Panama. In Panama we did Bocas del Toro, which had amazing snorkeling. Then we did Boquette which had some nice horseback riding or hiking in the mountain. Then we headed to a surf town of Santa Catalina and did snorkeling in Isa Coiba, which was stunning. Never have seen that many different types of large fish. Then we headed back up to Panama City for their old town and the canals.

So you are kind of picking between Mayan Ancient Culture + Beaches, vs mostly Nature/Adventure activities.

Edit: I've also been to Japan and loved it, but I think it might be on the shade of expensive for your budget., jadeoracle 
eh7bja0, au9klj, 2019-02-24 22:00:35,2019, 2, 24,Overall no. I enjoyed the overnight hike into Corcovado Nat‚Äôl Park - that was the highlight of my trip. Kayaking in the mangroves was nice. Saw a few dolphins - got lucky. Zip lining is boring. Chocolate farm tour is overrated. A lot of the activities are ripoffs imo. The beaches are nothing compared to beaches in Mexico imo. It‚Äôs black sand. But if you surf or want to learn I think you‚Äôll be happy in CR for that activity. Everything is overpriced! I felt like I was getting taken for a ride in terms of cost on all the activities and that left a bad taste in my mouth the whole time. 

The Osa was not crowded, which is why I chose it.  But it‚Äôs a small town and everything is set up for tourists so it‚Äôs touristy in that sense. It just had a canned feeling. However, I felt safe the whole time and people were hospitable. Obv it‚Äôs all subjective and depends on what you‚Äôre into. To me CR is an overrated place. , RevolutionaryHope8 
eh75ooh, au9klj, 2019-02-24 20:52:55,2019, 2, 24,Haha damn that sounds rough! Sounds like the all inclusive wasn't worth it based on your experiences. It kind of sounds like my experience in Jamaica.

eh752ry, au9klj, 2019-02-24 20:45:53,2019, 2, 24,It's 5k for both haha. I guess that changes a lot. 

Thanks for the elaborate answer. I like your way of breaking down each of the trips and what to expect if going for each of them! 

We're most likely not going to be diving in Belize (Don't have any experience with it) and was also told that it is more for experienced divers. Besides that we were told that there's not that much for us to do in Belize if we're not going to dive. I read about that ATM trip in Belize, sounds really cool!! 

If we're  doing the Guatemala/Belize trip we unfortunately won't have enough time for Mexico as we only got 2 weeks. Would you recommend Mexico as a separate trip also? 

Sounds like you've had an awesome trip! Do you think one week in Costa Rica and one in Panama would be enough to see most places or is it going to be too difficult to cramp everything into 2 weeks?

For Costa Rica and Panama [I did something similar to this](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/panama-experience/CRSP/) (but we didn't have the Valle de Anton part) So you could probably use those two days to visit La Fortuna in CR if you wanted the hot springs portion.

I strongly disagree.

Quite simply pickpocketing is one of the few crimes that is almost 100% preventable. Pickpockets don't have magical powers, they can't somehow mysteriously teleport your wallet into their possession, they need an opening/opportunity so they can get their grubby thieving hands on your valuables and that's easy to defend against.

Inside pockets with proper enclosures, zippers/buttons/Velcro, or a [simple product like this](http://shop.eaglecreek.com/money-belts-neck-wallets/l/312) make it practically impossible to lose your money, credit/debit cards, passport, etc.

Well, I would have probably already talked about this prior to going on the trip with them so everyone understood expectations, but yes, simply tell them. If you think you'll drink a lot, make sure they know your general plan in case things go wrong.

Generally, it is illegal to work or even "volunteer" if you are on a tourist visa. You'd need to apply for the proper work or volunteer visa instead.

> Also, I'm lazy so I'm avoiding any countries where I have to apply for a visa to gain entry.

That's stupid. Especially if you are taking a full year off and trying a "around the world" trip. This isn't something to be lazy about. Sure you can do less planning, but...you are taking a full year off. You can spend some time figuring out visas.

The difference in quality just can't be compared, and many times there are cost-saving benefits (like all-inclusive fare) which wind up making the luxury cruise a better deal.

When it comes to resorts? You really have to compare individual properties and costs. At Disney World, we go with a midrange room at a midrange resort to save money, but we've stayed at better rooms in all of the deluxe properties, and some of them aren't worth the cost. We had a free upgrade to concierge once, and the difference in quality would not have been worth an extra $500 a night.  , OddBirdsTravel

eh6w7mt, aub1cl, 2019-02-24 19:04:55,2019, 2, 24,So a few things. Firstly, you cannot legally work somewhere without a proper work visa.  This includes any "Volunteer Work" or work in exchange for room/board/food.  

Sure there are people who try to work illegally under the table,[ but we just had one yesterday where their employer shook them down for more money or threatened to send them to the authorities](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/atrqox/being_threatened_to_pay_5000_baht_if_i_want_to/). Working illegally opens you up for a lot of scams or worse, because your employer knows you have no protections and if you speak out you can get deported. Note that WWOOF, HelpX, etc are still usually considered illegal volunteer work. 

You likely won't qualify for a traditional work visa...as you have no career history or skills that would lead for a foreign-based company to hire you over a local recent graduate. It costs a company money to hire foreign workers, so unless you have skills in demand, don't expect a foreign company to hire you.

You might qualify for a "working holiday visa" due to your age, but unsure of your nationality. But simply google "Working Holiday Visa" and your nationality and figure out where you can go and apply. HOWEVER, this generally means you are going to be working the similar type jobs you'd have back home, just in a different country. AND you must work a specific set of time before you can travel on. So its not a vagabond situation. 

You may also want to hit up /r/IWantOut. 

While I do not advise or condone "being a vagabond abroad" as it generally means being homeless abroad (and looks horrible if you are begpacking in countries with lower income. Don't be a begpacker or busker trying to take money from locals in say countries like Thailand, Vietnam, etc.) But if you are set on that, you'll want to hit up /r/Shoestring, /r/UrbanSurvivalism/, /r/frugaltravelgear/, /r/simpleliving/, /r/Frugal/, /r/vandwellers/ or other similar frugal/small budget threads.

Or simply: /r/vagabond/ , jadeoracle

eh75jkb, aub1cl, 2019-02-24 20:51:18,2019, 2, 24,Why do you need $10,000/month?, Oax_Mike 
eh73pto, aub1cl, 2019-02-24 20:30:43,2019, 2, 24,Get hospitality experience and be a flight attendant or work a cruise ship. Or staff on boats. Or the military..., palolo_lolo 
eh72ftn, aub1cl, 2019-02-24 20:16:20,2019, 2, 24,You will need some experience and specializations in order for a foriegn employer to consider you for a work visa sponsorship. Even if you do end up getting that, you'd still be working a job in a fixed location.

It sounds like you want to be able to generate income while traveling and essentially being on vacation. Unless you can do some coding or other remote contract work, Im not exactly sure what you think you'll be able to do for work if you are not willing to stay in one place. There seems to be a misconception that foreign employers, particularly in developing countries would jump at the idea of hiring a westerner for under the table work. You salary expectations will be higher than a local and you don't really provide an extra benefits or skills to them. 

Being an English speaker is not a major benefit especially if you don't speak the local language. English speakers are fairly common.

eh73uej, aub1cl, 2019-02-24 20:32:11,2019, 2, 24,A BUNAC program? Find an agency that can get you out to a foreign country and you'll likely have accommodation and money in your pocket. You can try shoot for the stars with your degree though at r/IWantOut or speak to your college. No doubt there's some sort of careers advisors in your college who have heard of a student wanting to work abroad. They may even have connections.

I did a program where I worked abroad in the USA and got to travel after on a J-1 visa. I don't really recommend this specific program I went on but I'm like within the 5% who doesn't, and I still will say I had fun when I was over there. This was post graduation. 

My cousin done something similar and after he got an engineering degree, he spent months working at bars across NZ and Australia. Met a girl. Fell in love. Engaged.

Good luck! You can make anything happen if you set yourself on it!, Kroonay 
eh75whb, aub1cl, 2019-02-24 20:55:27,2019, 2, 24,This is a pretty broad question but the answer really is to find a market that is currently underserved, allows you to work on your own remotely, and then level up in that area. Additionally, it helps to find a side hustle for income in a cheap cost of living city while you do this., noappendix
