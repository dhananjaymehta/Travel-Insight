Not you though. I didn’t pay enough attention to usernames in the thread. My apologies. I confused you with that guy.

I’m American too. Driving on the other side of the road is way less challenging and dramatic than people think. Thankfully in the UK the steering wheel is on the right. It’s way more intuitive. They also use miles and not km on their roads which should help. The worst is places in the Caribbean like the USVI, BVI, and The Bahamas (not technically Caribbean, I know) where they use American vehicles with the steering wheel on the left but they also drive on the left. The visibility is so bad and it just doesn’t feel right. ,realjd

I’m American too. Driving on the other side of the road is way less challenging and dramatic than people think. Thankfully in the UK the steering wheel is on the right. It’s way more intuitive. They also use miles and not km on their roads which should help. The worst is places in the Caribbean like the USVI, BVI, and The Bahamas (not technically Caribbean, I know) where they use American vehicles with the steering wheel on the left but they also drive on the left.

Places like Inle Lake, Kalaw, Pindaya, Pyin Oo Lwin (tourist destinations) are for the most part calm and stable and have been spared from the ongoing conflict. There is very high security across the region and its practically impossible to reach the conflict zones as a foreigner.  ,globe_trekker

He used to live in England when he was in the military and isn’t exactly to the moon excited about any European travel at the moment but has expressed interest in visiting France, Italy, and Spain. I do not feel we will spend any excessive time in Europe in our travels. 

I really love the idea of traveling in South America! Trips to Puerto Rico are fairly accessible to us flight wise, as are certain other parts of Mexico. We really appreciate a lot of the Mayan culture and I can truly see us traveling extensively in those particular areas.

It doesn’t appear so ;).  French Guiana would be the only place in your list you would be able to speak French in.  In Vietnam even with their colonial history French has all but died out except for tour guides who speak it and the elderly.  You are more likely to find English speakers now than anything else in Vietnam. ,CivicBlues 
eh7rgbt, eh74tbk, auagug,2019-02-25 01:33:59, 2019, 2,25, Hmmm, Brazilians cannot understand Spanish as they speak fast and have a lot of accent? The opposite also doesn't happen. A lot of things to factor in such as accent, speed of speech and how words are spoken. I speak both languages and Portuguese has SO many words that are used in different contexts depending what you are talking about, and the slang list is mad long. Not to mention how some words do exist in both languages but they mean completely different things.

If you go to Brazil and assume they can understand you cause you speak Spanish so same, they will see that as somewhat as an insult as this is a very common mistake cause you know, they speak Portuguese lmao. Also, Brazilians tend to try to speak Spanish in a very unhelpful way by adding -ito to everything so it "sounds more like Spanish". 

Yet, whenever I try to show things in Portuguese to my Spanish speaker friends, they don't understand what they say.

You can go to Brazil with English, if you go to the big centers, you will most likely find some random dude that can at least tell you a thing or two. You have better chances with English than Spanish to be honest lmao. 

Unless you are in the mood to speak very slowly so they can hear every single part of the word you are saying. I went to Argentina knowing English and Portuguese, and my teacher told me she would teach me using Portuguese instead. But whenever I'd talk to my host in Portuguese, I had to do it very slowly because she wouldn't understand.

I guess take the risk lol ,louhbunni

It's 13 cities, starting in Prague and ending in Istanbul. Excluding flights in/out of Europe, I'm looking to spend around $3500. I could do it with $3000, but that'd be too shoestring for me. The biggest variation of my spending during trips is and always has been alcohol consumption. I'm a pretty heavy partier on trips, so I know to take that into consideration when budgeting. Everything else is budgeted to a tee though so let me know if you have any questions. ,rohansfinest

Some guys I knew said that there was just booze everywhere and the one they were going to stay at had bedbugs (so they went elsewhere). 

If you want that vibe then go for it, but Budapest is a city where you can drink and get super fucked up just about anywhere and it doesn’t have to be in or with a crappy party hostel.  ,blissfully_chilling

eh7q7ys, eh7dr55, aud45i,2019-02-25 01:16:09, 2019, 2,25, I agree with cutting out Kyoto - I very much like it, but I also very much think you need 4 days there. Haven't spent any real time in Osaka, haven't made it to Hiroshima.  

I echo the thoughts on weather - May and October are great. I have been to Tokyo in April (greyish) and December (a subtly very cool time to be in Japan. The summer time scares me. I had a brutally cold weekend in Seoul in December a couple years back. The only additional gotcha is that Kyoto has a very busy fall foliage season allegedly - make sure you understand when that is before booking say a last minute flight. ,terminal_e 
eh7g8ax, eh7fqhy, aud45i,2019-02-24 22:56:01, 2019, 2,24, Thanks, both of you suggest the schedule would be too much.  I know this is subjective, but with the idea that about a week in Korea would be non-negotiable, what would you cut out?  Cut out HK altogether, or cut out destinations in Japan?  Or both?

For some reason I've always wanted to visit the Atomic Bomb memorial/dome in Hiroshima, but Kyoto/Osaka might not be a must-see for me.  So I could just do Hiroshima then straight to Tokyo? ,Adult_Noob 
eh7i9ys, eh7fqhy, aud45i,2019-02-24 23:22:47, 2019, 2,24, It depends what you like more really! 

If you’re really into the idea of Asian cities then I’d go Hong Kong. There’s lots to see and it’s not too touristy. I really loved it there. 

But if you want a bit more variety and something less city-like then I’d probably keep in Kyoto instead. While it’s touristy, you can find peace in a beautiful tea garden... after battling selfie sticks in the bamboo forest and Unari gates!

Travel is also a consideration as flying to and from Hong Kong is a lot more time consuming and tiring (with the whole airport business) than getting the bullet train around Japan. 

Finally, Hong Kong is a good one to save for another time as it twins well with so many places (Macau, Thailand, Australia for starters). 

It’s a hard one - if I was to just pick between the two I’d go Hong Kong but with all the other considerations I’d stay in Japan for your trip! ,louiseoxford 
eh7lanp, eh7fqhy, aud45i,2019-02-25 00:04:55, 2019, 2,25, Thanks, this is very helpful.  I think your point about the travel logistics of HK is salient. Obviously being a separate country, having to fly in and out just for 1 city/short trip, etc might be a bit much. 

Japan and Korea seem much easier logistically to twin on a trip, and I could easily do 1 week in each. ,Adult_Noob

If you put them as children on Eurostar too (assuming theyre 11 or younger) it shows the same price as on Omio. The difference is Omio only has child (0-11) and adult (12+) tickets while Eurostar has child (0-11), youth (12-25), and adult (26+). ,panameboss

If you put them as children on Eurostar too (assuming theyre 11 or younger) it shows the same price as on Omio. The difference is Omio only has child (0-11) and adult (12+) tickets while Eurostar has child (0-11), youth (12-25), and adult (26+). ,panameboss

eh7tvgx, eh7ldju, aue321,2019-02-25 02:08:05, 2019, 2,25, Baltimore's airport is small and you won't have any trouble navigating it. You'll go downstairs to collect your baggage and you will probably walk right outside of the baggage claim doors to catch your ride. It's very simple; don't stress. 

As for the city, be aware of your surroundings. Shows like The Wire and Homicide haven't done the city any favors. But there's great stuff to see and visit- the Walters Art Museum and the Baltimore Museum of Art have excellent collections and are free. Fort McHenry is worth a stop. Eat a crab cake and some oysters. Visit Fells Point and Federal Hill.

The price is hight but the hotel food is terrible. Got food poisoning the very first day we came. My friends were at 5 star resort-same sht. All prices in usd, and better have usd money because exchange rates are pretty bad there. 
All tour we took had lunch included and a very tasty one. So we basically were eating mostly on tours lol. Some restaurants on beachfront that were close to our hotel had prices same as in toronto restaurants.. but the seafood is so good there so its worth it.  ,megatapka

eh79eec, eh6yllu, au9klj,2019-02-24 21:35:53, 2019, 2,24, Exactly. I will definitely go back but only as a backpacker. Tours are on a pricey side. I think we spent around 2k on them. Roughly starting from 100usd ,megatapka

It's just very difficult to choose, because you don't want to be wrong about the place you choose haha.  ,DatSafee 
eh74150, eh6z9te, au9klj,2019-02-24 20:34:18, 2019, 2,24, Thank you for your elaborate answer. Really appreciate it! 
It's not that we want some type of standard for $150, but just want something that is clean and spacious with everything working as it should. We're going to be outside of the apartment 90% of the time anyway, so it doesn't matter really if it's luxurious. As long as the location is good and it's clean. I guess it's also possible to get that for less than $100 a day if you know where to look? I found some Airbnb's for around $90 in the Kyoto/Osaka area. 
How many days each would you advice to stay in Tokyo and Kyoto? It seems like most people only spend 2-3 days in Tokyo and the rest in Kyoto to get around the rest of the country. How long did it take you to go from Tachikawa to the city center of Tokyo? 
Yeah I see everyone commenting on how efficient the train system is. I was just a little surprised by the rates they charged for 14 days. But I guess it's still a good deal considering you can get to anywhere in the country for that amount for 2 whole weeks.  ,DatSafee 
eh72wfv, eh6wmu1, au9klj,2019-02-24 20:21:33, 2019, 2,24, I would say around $5,000 and that's including flight tickets, accommodation, transportation and food costs. Yes that's why I could imagine it not being as satisfying as the other two trips.  ,DatSafee 
eh73qal, eh6wmu1, au9klj,2019-02-24 20:30:52, 2019, 2,24, 5K for two people? Or 5k each?

Either way, it sounds like the Central America trips would be better.

I've done both a Guatemala/Beliza/Mexico trip and a Costa Rica/Panama trip.

A Guatemala/Belize/Mexico would be good if you want culture. I started in Guatemala and saw the old colonial ruins of Antigua, then made my way to Florez and the Mayan ruins of Tikal. I then did the ATM caves in Belize, easily one of the coolest things I've done. (You get to see Mayan objects and sacrifices.) Then I headed to one of the islands for some beach/snorkeling time (although Caye Caulker doesn't have much of either, you have to take day trips by boat that ads extra costs.) And then we took a boat to Mexico and made our way up towards Cancun to see the Mayan ruins of Tulum and Chichen Itza and then some beach time in Cancun/Rivera Maya.

And I've done two trips to Costa Rica, one of which was a Costa Rica/Panama trip. I did a day in San Jose to hit up a tour of the National Theater, the Jade Museum, Gold Museum, History Museum, and did a walking tour with Barrio Birds, which was fun. Then I did white water rafting to Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, which is a fun backpackers beach town. I hung out by the beach but others went surfing or to the national parks nearby. (On a different trip I headed up to La Fortuna/La Arenal for the Volcano/Hot Springs/Cloud Forest.) Then we headed into Panama. In Panama we did Bocas del Toro, which had amazing snorkeling. Then we did Boquette which had some nice horseback riding or hiking in the mountain. Then we headed to a surf town of Santa Catalina and did snorkeling in Isa Coiba, which was stunning. Never have seen that many different types of large fish. Then we headed back up to Panama City for their old town and the canals.

So you are kind of picking between Mayan Ancient Culture + Beaches, vs mostly Nature/Adventure activities.

Edit: I've also been to Japan and loved it, but I think it might be on the shade of expensive for your budget. ,jadeoracle 
eh752ry, eh6wmu1, au9klj,2019-02-24 20:45:53, 2019, 2,24, It's 5k for both haha. I guess that changes a lot. 

Thanks for the elaborate answer. I like your way of breaking down each of the trips and what to expect if going for each of them! 

We're most likely not going to be diving in Belize (Don't have any experience with it) and was also told that it is more for experienced divers. Besides that we were told that there's not that much for us to do in Belize if we're not going to dive. I read about that ATM trip in Belize, sounds really cool!! 

If we're  doing the Guatemala/Belize trip we unfortunately won't have enough time for Mexico as we only got 2 weeks. Would you recommend Mexico as a separate trip also? 

Sounds like you've had an awesome trip! Do you think one week in Costa Rica and one in Panama would be enough to see most places or is it going to be too difficult to cramp everything into 2 weeks? 

Yes I rather wanna do Japan proper if I'm going to do it at all, meaning I get the full experience without worrying about the financials :)  ,DatSafee 
eh763we, eh6wmu1, au9klj,2019-02-24 20:57:50, 2019, 2,24, I did the Guatemala/Belize/Mexico trip as a 12 day trip (with a day extra in Guatemala and one in Mexico), you can see the [itinerary here that I used](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/mayan-encounter/CGME/). So it is possible. I've not done other parts of Mexico so couldn't speak to that as a separate trip. In Belize I did snorkeling not diving. They have a barrier reef and it was a fun day-sail and snorkel, I got to swim with nurse sharks and rays! I forgot I have a [detailed write up ATM if you need any info on that](https://liliontheloose.com/2016/01/28/breathtaking-crystal-maiden-at-actun-tunichil-muknal-atm-cave/). In Antigua I also did a [chocolate making class](https://liliontheloose.com/2015/06/18/making-chocolate-in-antigua-guatemala/) which was a lot of fun.

For Costa Rica and Panama [I did something similar to this](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/panama-experience/CRSP/) (but we didn't have the Valle de Anton part) So you could probably use those two days to visit La Fortuna in CR if you wanted the hot springs portion. 

Exactly how I feel about Japan too! When I first went I was on a summer exchange program, so stayed in one town the entire time. I had so much fun, but now thinking about Japan again and I want to do it properly, which takes some money to see it all! ,jadeoracle

eh7bja0, eh75wr9, au9klj,2019-02-24 22:00:35, 2019, 2,24, Overall no. I enjoyed the overnight hike into Corcovado Nat’l Park - that was the highlight of my trip. Kayaking in the mangroves was nice. Saw a few dolphins - got lucky. Zip lining is boring. Chocolate farm tour is overrated. A lot of the activities are ripoffs imo. The beaches are nothing compared to beaches in Mexico imo. It’s black sand. But if you surf or want to learn I think you’ll be happy in CR for that activity. Everything is overpriced! I felt like I was getting taken for a ride in terms of cost on all the activities and that left a bad taste in my mouth the whole time. 

The Osa was not crowded, which is why I chose it.  But it’s a small town and everything is set up for tourists so it’s touristy in that sense. It just had a canned feeling. However, I felt safe the whole time and people were hospitable. Obv it’s all subjective and depends on what you’re into. To me CR is an overrated place.  ,RevolutionaryHope8 
eh74zcc, eh73bez, au9klj,2019-02-24 20:44:50, 2019, 2,24, Yeah, getting up 5-6 am, driving...we call it vacation 😂 We actually stayed at all inclusive resort, but dont ever do that in costa rica. The price is hight but the hotel food is terrible. Got food poisoning the very first day we came. My friends were at 5 star resort-same sht. All prices in usd, and better have usd money because exchange rates are pretty bad there. 
All tour we took had lunch included and a very tasty one. So we basically were eating mostly on tours lol. Some restaurants on beachfront that were close to our hotel had prices same as in toronto restaurants.. but the seafood is so good there so its worth it.  ,megatapka 
eh75ooh, eh73bez, au9klj,2019-02-24 20:52:55, 2019, 2,24, Haha damn that sounds rough! Sounds like the all inclusive wasn't worth it based on your experiences.

eh79eec, eh73bez, au9klj,2019-02-24 21:35:53, 2019, 2,24, Exactly. I will definitely go back but only as a backpacker. Tours are on a pricey side. I think we spent around 2k on them. Roughly starting from 100usd ,megatapka

eh73qal, eh72wfv, au9klj,2019-02-24 20:30:52, 2019, 2,24, 5K for two people? Or 5k each?

Either way, it sounds like the Central America trips would be better.

I've done both a Guatemala/Beliza/Mexico trip and a Costa Rica/Panama trip.

A Guatemala/Belize/Mexico would be good if you want culture. I started in Guatemala and saw the old colonial ruins of Antigua, then made my way to Florez and the Mayan ruins of Tikal. I then did the ATM caves in Belize, easily one of the coolest things I've done. (You get to see Mayan objects and sacrifices.) Then I headed to one of the islands for some beach/snorkeling time (although Caye Caulker doesn't have much of either, you have to take day trips by boat that ads extra costs.) And then we took a boat to Mexico and made our way up towards Cancun to see the Mayan ruins of Tulum and Chichen Itza and then some beach time in Cancun/Rivera Maya.

And I've done two trips to Costa Rica, one of which was a Costa Rica/Panama trip. I did a day in San Jose to hit up a tour of the National Theater, the Jade Museum, Gold Museum, History Museum, and did a walking tour with Barrio Birds, which was fun. Then I did white water rafting to Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, which is a fun backpackers beach town. I hung out by the beach but others went surfing or to the national parks nearby. (On a different trip I headed up to La Fortuna/La Arenal for the Volcano/Hot Springs/Cloud Forest.) Then we headed into Panama. In Panama we did Bocas del Toro, which had amazing snorkeling. Then we did Boquette which had some nice horseback riding or hiking in the mountain. Then we headed to a surf town of Santa Catalina and did snorkeling in Isa Coiba, which was stunning. Never have seen that many different types of large fish. Then we headed back up to Panama City for their old town and the canals.

So you are kind of picking between Mayan Ancient Culture + Beaches, vs mostly Nature/Adventure activities.

Edit: I've also been to Japan and loved it, but I think it might be on the shade of expensive for your budget. ,jadeoracle

Thanks for the elaborate answer. I like your way of breaking down each of the trips and what to expect if going for each of them! 

We're most likely not going to be diving in Belize (Don't have any experience with it) and was also told that it is more for experienced divers. Besides that we were told that there's not that much for us to do in Belize if we're not going to dive. I read about that ATM trip in Belize, sounds really cool!! 

If we're  doing the Guatemala/Belize trip we unfortunately won't have enough time for Mexico as we only got 2 weeks. Would you recommend Mexico as a separate trip also? 

Sounds like you've had an awesome trip! Do you think one week in Costa Rica and one in Panama would be enough to see most places or is it going to be too difficult to cramp everything into 2 weeks? 

Yes I rather wanna do Japan proper if I'm going to do it at all, meaning I get the full experience without worrying about the financials :)  ,DatSafee

Thank you for being so helpful!! ,blogger6666 
eh7qxxp, eh7lrhf, au4ne6,2019-02-25 01:26:37, 2019, 2,25, I'm down for white water rafting too, but the rating of class is only 2-3. Do you know any rafting that's a bit more thriller than that around West Glacier? 

Thanks!!!! ,blogger6666

It does get boring but it's better early than never when it comes to flights. You can wait 15 minutes it's for the next bus into the city or train but with flights, never be on time.  ,Kroonay 
eh7jga2, eh7ggwb, aubphw,2019-02-24 23:39:07, 2019, 2,24, The customs/immigration lines are really the luck of the draw, though. The last time I came into O'Hare internationally we were synced up with three other flights but I was still from gate to Lyft in like 50 minutes. ,itslazza
